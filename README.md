## The Assignment
The goal of the assignment was to select and curate a dataset, design an algorithm to process the dataset in a meaningful way, and to implement a simple website to present basic information about the project.

## The Dataset
The dataset contains information about references concerning latent tuberculosis and cascade of care.

## The Algorithm
The goal of the algorithm is to allow the user to select a parameter and a parameter value in order to obtain a subset of the dataset containing only references satisfying the parameter.

## The Website
The website providing information about the project can be reached through the following link <https://squonkbadger.github.io/datathink-a3/>

## This A3 Project complies with the minimum requirements
- The dataset has been curated for the algorithm to perform properly, contains 59 items, and has a well-formed .xml file with a DTD.
- The algorithm is written in a markdown file using pseudocode, has 50 lines of code, and includes a path, multiple variables, and several selections and iterations.
- The website contains the files index.html, dataset.html, algorithm.html, and people.html.
- The assignment is submitted as a GitHub repository.
- The website uses the GitHub Pages.
