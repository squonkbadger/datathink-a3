            <abstract>
                Reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health (RMNCH) has been a priority
                for both governments and civil society in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).
                This priority was affirmed by world leaders in the Millennium Development Goals
                (MDGs)
                that called for countries to reduce child mortality by 67 percent and maternal
                mortality by 75 percent between 1990 and 2015. Although substantial progress on
                these targets has been made, few countries achieved the needed reductions. The
                United Nations (UN) Secretary-General’s Global Strategy for Women’s and Children’s
                Health, launched in 2010 and expanded in 2015 to include adolescents, is an
                indication
                of the continued global commitment to the survival and well-being of women and
                children
                (Ban 2010). Annual official development assistance for maternal, newborn, and
                child health has increased from US$2.7 billion in 2003 to US$8.3 billion in
                2012, when there was an additional US$4.5 billion for reproductive health
                (Arregoces and others 2015). A continued focus on RMNCH is needed to address the
                remaining considerable burden of disease in LMICs from unwanted pregnancies;
                high maternal, newborn, and child mortality and stillbirths; high rates of
                undernutrition; frequent communicable and noncommunicable diseases; and loss of
                human capacity. Cost-effective interventions are available and can be
                implemented at high coverage in LMICs to greatly reduce these problems at an
                affordable cost. RMNCH encompasses health problems across the life course from
                adolescent girls and women before and during pregnancy and delivery, to newborns
                and children. An important conceptual framework is the continuum-of-care
                approach in two dimensions. One dimension recognizes the links from mother to
                child and the need for health services across the stages of the life course. The
                other is the delivery of integrated preventive and therapeutic health
                interventions through service platforms ranging from the community to the
                primary health center and the hospital. This volume presents the levels and
                trends of RMNCH indicators, proven interventions for prevention of mortality,
                costs of these interventions and potential health service delivery platforms,
                and system innovations. Other volumes in the third edition of Disease Control
                Priorities also cover topics of importance to women and children that are
                related to the RMNCH health services packages (box 1.1). These topics include
                the following: Trauma care; obstetric surgery; obstetric fistula; surgery for
                family planning, abortion, and postabortion care; and surgery for congenital
                anomalies (Volume 1, Essential Surgery). Breast cancer, cervical cancer and
                precancer, childhood cancer, and cancer pain relief (Volume 3, Cancer).
                Childhood mental and developmental disorders (Volume 4, Mental, Neurological,
                and Substance Use Disorders). Cardiovascular and respiratory disorders (Volume
                5, Cardiovascular, Respiratory, and Related Disorders). HIV/AIDS and other
                sexually transmitted infections, tuberculosis, and malaria (Volume 6, HIV/AIDS,
                STIs, tuberculosis, and Malaria). Road traffic injury and interpersonal violence
                (Volume 7, Injury Prevention and Environmental Health). Child (older than five
                years) and adolescent development (the subject of the entire Volume 8, Child and
                Adolescent Development).

            <abstract>
                BACKGROUND: Socially complex groups,
                including people experiencing homelessness, prisoners and drug users, have very
                high levels of tuberculosis, often complicated by late diagnosis and difficulty
                in adhering to treatment. OBJECTIVE: To assess a series of interventions to
                improve tuberculosis control in socially complex groups. DESIGN: A series of
                observational surveys, evaluations and trials of interventions. SETTING: The
                pan-London Find&amp;Treat service, which supports tuberculosis screening and
                case management in socially complex groups across London. PARTICIPANTS: Socially
                complex groups with tuberculosis or at risk of tuberculosis, including people
                experiencing homelessness, prisoners, drug users and those at high risk of poor
                adherence to tuberculosis treatment. INTERVENTIONS AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: We
                screened 491 people in homeless hostels and 511 people in prison for latent
                tuberculosis infection, human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B and hepatitis
                C. We evaluated an NHS-led prison radiographic screening programme. We conducted
                a cluster randomised controlled trial (2348 eligible people experiencing
                homelessness in 46 hostels) of the effectiveness of peer educators (22 hostels)
                compared with NHS staff (24 hostels) at encouraging the uptake of mobile
                radiographic screening. We initiated a trial of the use of point-of-care
                polymerase chain reaction diagnostics to rapidly confirm tuberculosis alongside
                mobile radiographic screening. We undertook a randomised controlled trial to
                improve treatment adherence, comparing face-to-face, directly observed treatment
                with video-observed treatment using a smartphone application. The primary
                outcome was completion of ≥ 80% of scheduled treatment observations over the
                first 2 months following enrolment. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of latent
                tuberculosis screening alongside radiographic screening of people experiencing
                homelessness. The costs of video-observed treatment and directly observed
                treatment were compared. RESULTS: In the homeless hostels, 16.5% of people
                experiencing homelessness had latent tuberculosis infection, 1.4% had current
                hepatitis B infection, 10.4% had hepatitis C infection and 1.0% had human
                immunodeficiency virus infection. When a quality-adjusted life-year is valued at
                £30,000, the latent tuberculosis screening of people experiencing homelessness
                was cost-effective provided treatment uptake was ≥ 25% (for a £20,000
                quality-adjusted life-year threshold, treatment uptake would need to be &gt;
                50%). In prison, 12.6% of prisoners had latent tuberculosis infection, 1.9% had
                current hepatitis B infection, 4.2% had hepatitis C infection and 0.0% had human
                immunodeficiency virus infection. In both settings, levels of latent
                tuberculosis infection and blood-borne viruses were higher among injecting drug
                users. A total of 1484 prisoners were screened using chest radiography over a
                total of 112 screening days (new prisoner screening coverage was 43%).
                Twenty-nine radiographs were reported as potentially indicating tuberculosis.
                One prisoner began, and completed, antituberculosis treatment in prison. In the
                cluster randomised controlled trial of peer educators to increase screening
                uptake, the median uptake was 45% in the control arm and 40% in the intervention
                arm (adjusted risk ratio 0.98, 95% confidence interval 0.80 to 1.20). A rapid
                diagnostic service was established on the mobile radiographic unit but the trial
                of rapid diagnostics was abandoned because of recruitment and follow-up
                difficulties. We randomly assigned 112 patients to video-observed treatment and
                114 patients to directly observed treatment. Fifty-eight per cent of those
                recruited had a history of homelessness, addiction, imprisonment or severe
                mental health problems. Seventy-eight (70%) of 112 patients on video-observed
                treatment achieved the primary outcome, compared with 35 (31%) of 114 patients
                on directly observed treatment (adjusted odds ratio 5.48, 95% confidence
                interval 3.10 to 9.68; p &lt; 0.0001). Video-observed treatment was superior to
                directly observed treatment in all demographic and social risk factor subgroups.
                The cost for 6 months of treatment observation was £1645 for daily
                video-observed treatment, £3420 for directly observed treatment three times per
                week and £5700 for directly observed treatment five times per week. LIMITATIONS:
                Recruitment was lower than anticipated for most of the studies. The peer
                advocate study may have been contaminated by the fact that the service was
                already using peer educators to support its work. CONCLUSIONS: There are very
                high levels of latent tuberculosis infection among prisoners, people
                experiencing homelessness and drug users. Screening for latent infection in
                people experiencing homelessness alongside mobile radiographic screening would
                be cost-effective, providing the uptake of treatment was 25–50%. Despite
                ring-fenced funding, the NHS was unable to establish static radiographic
                screening programmes. Although we found no evidence that peer educators were
                more effective than health-care workers in encouraging the uptake of mobile
                radiographic screening, there may be wider benefits of including peer educators
                as part of the Find&amp;Treat team. Utilising polymerase chain reaction-based
                rapid diagnostic testing on a mobile radiographic unit is feasible.
                Smartphone-enabled video-observed treatment is more effective and cheaper than
                directly observed treatment for ensuring that treatment is observed. FUTURE
                WORK: Trials of video-observed treatment in high-incidence settings are needed.

            <abstract>
                DNA fingerprints of mycobacterium
                tuberculosis complex bacteria (MTBC) are routinely gathered from tuberculosis
                (TB) patient isolates for all TB patients in the United States to support TB
                tracking and control efforts, but few tools are available for visualizing and
                discovering host-pathogen relationships. We present a new visualization
                approach, host-pathogen maps, for simultaneously examining MTBC strains
                genotyped by multiple DNA fingerprinting methods such as spoligotyping and
                restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) typing along with associated
                patient surveillance data. The host-pathogen maps are dynamically coupled with
                spoligoforests or other phylogenetic tree approaches to allow easy navigation
                within the pathogen genotyping space. Visualization of New York State and New
                York City (NYC) TB patient data from 2001-2007 is used to illustrate how
                host-pathogen maps can be used to rapidly identify potential instances of
                uncontrolled spread of tuberculosis versus disease resulting from latent
                reactivation of prior infection, a critical distinction in tuberculosis control.
                Host-pathogen maps also reveal trends and anomalies in the relationships between
                patient groups and MTBC genetic lineages which can provide critical clues in
                epidemiology and contact investigations of TB. © 2011 IEEE.

                tuberculosis (TB) in the bovine is
                one of the most predominant chronic debilitating infectious diseases primarily
                caused by mycobacterium bovis. Besides, the incidence of TB in humans due to M.
                bovis, and that in bovines due to M. tuberculosis-indicates cattle as a major
                reservoir of zoonotic TB. While India accounts for the highest global burden of
                both TB and multidrug-resistant TB in humans, systematic evaluation of bovine TB
                (bTB) prevalence in India is largely lacking. Recent reports emphasized markedly
                greater bTB prevalence in exotic and crossbred cattle compared to indigenous
                cattle breeds that represent more than one-third of the total cattle population
                in India, which is the largest globally. This study aimed at elucidating the
                immune responses underlying the differential bTB incidence in prominent
                indigenous (Sahiwal), and crossbred (Sahiwal x Holstein Friesian) cattle reared
                in India. Employing the standard Single Intradermal Tuberculin Test (SITT), and
                mycobacterial gene-targeting single as well as multiplex-PCR-based screening
                revealed higher incidences of bovine tuberculin reactors as well as
                mycobacterium tuberculosis Complex specific PCR positivity amongst the crossbred
                cattle. Further, ex vivo mycobacterial infection in cultures of bovine
                peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from SITT, and myco-PCR negative
                healthy cattle exhibited significantly higher intracellular growth of M. bovis
                bcg, and M. tuberculosis H37Ra in the crossbred cattle PBMCs compared to native
                cattle. In addition, native cattle PBMCs induced higher pro-inflammatory
                cytokines and signaling pathways, such as interferon-gamma (IFN-γ),
                interleukin-17 (IL-17), and tank binding kinase-1 (TBK-1) upon exposure to live
                mycobacterial infection in comparison to PBMCs from crossbred cattle that
                exhibited higher expression of IL-1β transcripts. Together, these findings
                highlight that differences in the innate immune responses of these cattle breeds
                might be contributing to the differential susceptibility to TB infection, and
                the resultant disparity in bTB incidence amongst indigenous, and crossbred
                cattle.

                Background: tuberculosis (TB) is a
                leading infectious cause of death worldwide and treating latent TB infection
                (LTBI) with TB preventative therapy is a global priority. This study aimed to
                measure interferon gamma (IFN-γ) release assay (IGRA) positivity (the current
                reference standard for LTBI diagnosis) and Mtb-specific IgG antibodies in
                otherwise healthy HIV-negative and HIV-positive adults. Methods: One-hundred and
                eighteen adults (65 HIV-negative and 53 antiretroviral-naïve HIV-positive), from
                a peri-urban setting in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa were enrolled. IFN-γ release
                following stimulation with ESAT-6/CFP-10 peptides and plasma IgG antibodies
                specific for multiple Mtb antigens were measured using the QuantiFERON-TB Gold
                Plus (QFT) and customized Luminex assays, respectively. The relationships
                between QFT status and anti-Mtb IgG levels and HIV-status, sex, age and CD4
                count were analyzed. Findings: Older age, male sex and higher CD4 count were
                independently associated with QFT positivity (p = 0.045, 0.05 and 0.002
                respectively). There was no difference in QFT status between HIV-positive and
                HIV-negative groups (58% and 65% respectively, p = 0.06), but within CD4 count
                quartiles, people with HIV had higher QFT positivity than people without HIV (p
                = 0.008 (2nd quartile), &lt;0.0001 (3rd quartile)). Mtb-specific IFN-γ levels
                were lowest, and Mtb-specific IgGs were highest in HIV-positive individuals with
                the lowest CD4 counts. Interpretation: These results suggest that the QFT assay
                underestimates LTBI among immunosuppressed people with HIV and Mtb-specific IgG
                may be a useful alternative biomarker for Mtb infection. Further evaluation of
                how Mtb-specific antibodies can be leveraged to improve LTBI diagnosis is
                warranted, particularly in HIV-endemic areas.

                Objectives. To better understand the
                pathogenesis of pericardial tuberculosis (PCTB), we sought to characterize the
                systemic inflammatory profile in HIV-1-infected participants with latent TB
                infection (LTBI), pulmonary TB (PTB) and PCTB. Methods. Using Luminex, we
                measured 39 analytes in pericardial fluid (PCF) and paired plasma from 18 PCTB
                participants, and plasma from 16 LTBI and 20 PTB. Follow-up plasma samples were
                also obtained from PTB and PCTB participants. HLA-DR expression on Mtb-specific
                CD4 T cells was measured in baseline samples using flow cytometry. Results.
                Assessment of the overall systemic inflammatory profile by principal component
                analysis showed that the inflammatory profile of active TB participants was
                distinct from the LTBI group, while PTB patients could not be distinguished from
                those with PCTB. In the LTBI group, 12 analytes showed a positive association
                with plasma HIV-1 viral load, and most of these associations were lost in the
                diseased groups. When comparing the inflammatory profile between PCF and paired
                blood, we found that the concentrations of most analytes (24/39) were elevated
                at site of disease. However, the inflammatory profile in PCF partially mirrored
                inflammatory events in the blood. After TB treatment completion, the overall
                plasma inflammatory profile reverted to those observed in the LTBI group.
                Lastly, HLA-DR expression showed the best performance for TB diagnosis compared
                to previously described biosignatures built from soluble markers. Conclusion.
                Our results describe the inflammatory profile associated with PTB and PCTB and
                emphasize the potential role of HLA-DR as a promising biomarker for TB
                diagnosis.

                Background: tuberculosis (TB) has a
                serious impact on people’s health. China is one of 30 countries that has a high
                TB burden. As the currently decreasing speed of the incidence of TB, the WHO’s
                goal of “End TB Strategy” is hard to achieve by 2035. As a result, a SEIR model
                that determines the impact of different tuberculosis preventive treatments
                (TPTs) in different age groups, and the effect of different interventions on
                latent TB infections (LTBIs) in China is developed. Methods: A
                Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model was established.
                Goodness-of-fit tests were used to assess model performance. Predictive analysis
                was used to assess the effect of different interventions on LTBIs and achieving
                the goals of the “End TB Strategy”. Results: The Chi-square test indicated the
                model provided a good statistical fit to previous data on the incidence of TB
                (χ2 = 0.3085, p &gt; 0.999). The 1HP treatment regimen (daily rifapentine +
                isoniazid for 4 weeks) was most effective in reducing the number of TB cases by
                2035. The model indicated that several strategies could achieve the 2035 target
                of the “End TB Strategy”: completion of active case finding (ACF) for LTBI and
                TPT nation-wide within 5 years; completion of ACF for LTBIs and TPT within 2
                years in high-incidence areas; completion of TPT in the elderly within 2 years;
                or introduction of a new vaccine in which the product of annual doses and
                vaccine efficiency in the three age groups above 14 years old reached 10.5
                million. Conclusion: The incidence of TB in China declined gradually from 2005
                to 2019. Implementation of ACF for LTBIs and TPT nation-wide or in areas with
                high incidence, in the elderly, or administration of a new and effective vaccine
                could greatly reduce the number of TB cases and achieve the 2035 target of the
                “End TB Strategy” in China.

                Background: Preventive therapy of
                latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is an important component of tuberculosis
                (TB) control. Research on acceptance of TB preventive therapy (TPT) is an
                important topic. Current studies focus on acceptability and compliance. However,
                it is unclear whether LTBI patients will start TPT after accepting treatment.
                The study assessed the factors associated with TPT refusal after initial
                willingness to accept treatment. Methods: Data were derived from a baseline
                survey of prospective study of LTBI treatment among college students in Shandong
                Province, China. A total of 723 students initially willing to accept TPT were
                included in the analysis. Stepwise logistic regression was used to explore the
                individual- and family-level characteristic variables that factors associated
                with TPT refusal after initial willingness to accept treatment. Results: Of the
                723 LTBI college students who initially had acceptance willingness, 436 (60.3%)
                finally refused TPT. At the individual level, non-medical students were more
                likely to refuse TPT [odds ratio (OR) = 4.87, 95% confidence interval (CI):
                3.10–7.67)], as were students with moderate physical activity (OR = 1.45, 95%
                CI: 1.04–2.04). Students with boarding experience (OR = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.31–0.78)
                and a high level of knowledge about TB (OR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.95–0.99) were less
                likely to refuse TPT. At the family level, those with high father’s educational
                level (OR = 1.50, 95% CI: 1.07–2.10) or high household income (OR = 1.80, 95%
                CI: 1.20–2.71) were more likely to refuse TPT after initially accepting
                treatment. Conclusions: Factors associated with TPT refusal after initial
                willingness to accept treatment, such as personal (type of students, physical
                activity, boarding experiences, knowledge of TB) and family characteristics
                (father’s education level, household income) among college student with LTBI,
                might help identify persons for whom tailored interventions could improve the
                start of LTBI treatment.

                BACKGROUND: HIV is one of the
                deadliest epidemics and one of the most critical global public health issues.
                Some are susceptible to die among people living with HIV and some survive
                longer. The aim of the present study is to use mixture cure models to estimate
                factors affecting short- and long-term survival of HIV patients. METHODS: The
                total sample size was 2170 HIV-infected people referred to the disease
                counseling centers in Kermanshah Province, in the west of Iran, from 1998 to
                2019. A Semiparametric PH mixture cure model and a mixture cure frailty model
                were fitted to the data. Also, a comparison between these two models was
                performed. RESULTS: Based on the results of the mixture cure frailty model,
                antiretroviral therapy, tuberculosis infection, history of imprisonment, and
                mode of HIV transmission influenced short-term survival time (p-value &lt;
                0.05). On the other hand, prison history, antiretroviral therapy, mode of HIV
                transmission, age, marital status, gender, and education were significantly
                associated with long-term survival (p-value &lt; 0.05). The concordance criteria
                (K-index) value for the mixture cure frailty model was 0.65 whereas for the
                semiparametric PH mixture cure model was 0.62. CONCLUSION: This study showed
                that the frailty mixture cure models is more suitable in the situation where the
                studied population consisted of two groups, susceptible and non-susceptible to
                the event of death. The people with a prison history, who received ART
                treatment, and contracted HIV through injection drug users survive longer.
                Health professionals should pay more attention to these findings in HIV
                prevention and treatment.

                the tuberculosis (TB) disease burden and associated factors vary substantially
                across states. While public health agencies must choose how to deploy resources
                to combat TB and latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), state-level modeling
                analyses to inform policy decisions have not been widely available. Methods: We
                developed a mathematical model of TB epidemiology linked to a web-based user
                interface — Tabby2. The model is calibrated to epidemiological and demographic
                data for the United States, each U.S. state, and the District of Columbia. Users
                can simulate pre-defined scenarios describing approaches to TB prevention and
                treatment or create their own intervention scenarios. Location-specific results
                for epidemiological outcomes, service utilization, costs, and cost-effectiveness
                are reported as downloadable tables and customizable visualizations. To
                demonstrate the tool’s functionality, we projected trends in TB outcomes without
                additional intervention for all 50 states and the District of Columbia. We
                further undertook a case study of expanded treatment of LTBI among non-U.S.–born
                individuals in Massachusetts, covering 10% of the target population annually
                over 2025-2029. Results: Between 2022 and 2050, TB incidence rates were
                projected to decline in all states and the District of Columbia. Incidence
                projections for the year 2050 ranged from 0.03 to 3.8 cases (median 0.95) per
                100,000 persons. By 2050, we project that majority (&gt; 50%) of TB will be
                diagnosed among non-U.S.–born persons in 46 states and the District of Columbia;
                per state percentages range from 17.4% to 96.7% (median 83.0%). In
                Massachusetts, expanded testing and treatment for LTBI in this population was
                projected to reduce cumulative TB cases between 2025 and 2050 by 6.3% and
                TB-related deaths by 8.4%, relative to base case projections. This intervention
                had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $180,951 (2020 USD) per
                quality-adjusted life year gained from the societal perspective. Conclusions:
                Tabby2 allows users to estimate the costs, impact, and cost-effectiveness of
                different TB prevention approaches for multiple geographic areas in the United
                States. Expanded testing and treatment for LTBI could accelerate declines in TB
                incidence in the United States, as demonstrated in the Massachusetts case study.

                In 1991, the 44th World Health
                Assembly set two key targets for global tuberculosis (TB) control to be reached
                by 2000: 70% case detection of acid-fast bacilli smear-positive TB patients
                under the DOTS strategy recommended by WHO and 85% treatment success of those
                detected. This paper describes how TB control was scaled up to achieve these
                targets; it also considers the barriers encountered in reaching the targets,
                with a particular focus on how HIV infection affects TB control. Strong TB
                control will be facilitated by scaling-up WHO-recommended TB/HIV collaborative
                activities and by improving coordination between HIV and TB control programmes;
                in particular, to ensure control of drug-resistant TB. Required activities
                include more HIV counselling and testing of TB patients, greater use and
                acceptance of isoniazid as a preventive treatment in HIVinfected individuals,
                screening for active TB in HIV-care settings, and provision of universal access
                to antiretroviral treatment for all HIV-infected individuals eligible for such
                treatment. Integration of TB and HIV services in all facilities (i.e. in
                HIV-care settings and in TB clinics), especially at the periphery, is needed to
                effectively treat those infected with both diseases, to prolong their survival
                and to maximize limited human resources. Global TB targets can be met,
                particularly if there is renewed attention to TB/HIV collaborative activities
                combined with tremendous political commitment and will.

            <abstract>
                There are 2 accepted tests for the
                identification of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), the tuberculin skin test
                (TST) and the interferon gamma release assay (IGRA). TST involves an intradermal
                injection of a purified protein derivative into the lower part of the arm and
                waiting to see whether the patient has a reaction to the injection; whereas,
                IGRA is a blood test that measures the person’s immune response to TB proteins.
                There are differences with regard to the cost, ease of use, skill, and
                laboratory equipment required for these 2 tests. There may be differences in the
                accuracy of these tests in specific populations, such as those with previous
                Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (bcg) vaccination. In August 2020, CADTH searched the
                literature for evidence on the clinical utility, the costeffectiveness, and
                evidence-based guidelines regarding the use of the IGRA for identifying LTBI in
                people with previous bcg vaccination. That report identified 1 non-randomized
                study and 1 evidence-based guideline that were potentially relevant, but no
                economic evaluations. The purpose of the current report is to review the full
                texts of these publications, and to summarize and critically appraise the
                eligible publications. This report is a component of a larger CADTH Condition
                Level Review on tuberculosis. A condition level review is an assessment that
                incorporates all aspects of a condition, including prevention, detection,
                treatment, and management. For more information on CADTH’s Condition Level
                Review of tuberculosis, please visit the project page

            <abstract>
                tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious
                disease caused by the bacteria mycobacterium tuberculosis and is transmitted
                through the air by those who are infected with the bacteria (i.e., coughing).
                According to the World Health Organization (WHO), roughly a quarter of the
                world’s population is infected with M. tuberculosis and may be at risk for
                developing the disease. TB typically affects the lungs of a person (i.e.,
                pulmonary TB) but can also spread to other parts of the body (i.e.,
                extrapulmonary TB). TB is prevalent in low and middle income countries, as the
                disease is associated with poverty, poor sanitation or hygiene practices and
                being easily transmissible from person to person. However, high income
                countries, including Canada, still report cases of TB and it is considered an
                important public health matter. According to the Public Health Agency of Canada
                (PHAC), Canada has one of the lowest rates of active TB in the world. However,
                annual rates of TB have remained the same in the country since the 1980’s rather
                than steadily declining. In 2017, PHAC reported 1,796 cases of active TB in
                Canada with migrants and Indigenous peoples bearing the highest rates of active
                TB in the country and approximately 70% of cases being pulmonary TB.(,) Migrants
                and Indigenous peoples are not the only populations that are at higher risk of
                TB infection in Canada. Workers travelling to areas with a high incidence of TB,
                and those individuals who are immunocompromised (e.g., patients living with HIV,
                children, infants) or workers (e.g., health care professional) who are in direct
                contact with immunocompromised people are also at high risk of TB infection.
                Additionally, homeless persons, prison staff and inmates are considered
                high-risk populations due to the proximity to others and conditions that enable
                the transmission of TB bacteria. Individuals with TB are categorized into latent
                TB infection (LTBI) and active TB disease.(,) LTBI refers to an individual who
                has the M. tuberculosis infection in which the bacteria are alive but are not
                currently causing active TB disease. Persons with LTBI do not possess any
                symptoms and are not considered infectious. However, those with the LTBI can
                develop active TB disease if they do not receive proper treatment or have a
                compromised immune system. Active TB disease (also known as active TB) occurs
                when the TB bacteria begins to multiply and the individual’s immune system is
                compromised, leading to infection. Symptoms can progress right away or can
                develop long after infection, depending on the individual. Symptoms can vary
                between individuals who have TB infection but often experience weight loss,
                fever, fatigue, chills, excessive coughing and chest pain. In comparison to
                LTBI, persons with TB disease can spread the TB bacteria to others and are
                considered infectious. Early identification of TB is critical to receive timely
                treatment, reduce poor health outcomes, and to reduce the transmission of TB.
                Many people with LTBI initially go undetected and are often only diagnosed when
                they develop symptoms from developing active TB. Screening LTBI may be
                selectively done in groups of individuals who have a higher-risk of either being
                exposed to TB (e.g., health care workers, prison staff, people living in areas
                with high TB incidence) or of developing active TB diseases (e.g.,
                immunosuppressed individuals, patient living with HIV), or in people who have
                been come into contact with a person with TB (i.e., contact tracing). The
                identification of LTBI is done through tuberculin skin test (TST) and the
                interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA); these diagnostic tools cannot
                differentiate between latent and active TB.(,) The TST is performed by injecting
                a small amount of tuberculin into the lower part of the arm and to see whether
                the patient has a reaction to the injection, while the IGRA is a blood test that
                measures the person’s immune response to TB proteins. Diagnosing active TB
                disease is more involved, and can include recognizing the signs and symptoms of
                TB, chest radiography, sputum samples, and microbiologic testing. Active case
                finding can also be used to systematically search for cases of active TB disease
                in populations with a high risk of TB rather than waiting for individuals to
                present symptoms of the disease. There are multiple guidelines published about
                TB, and these guidelines may vary in quality and the topics covered on
                identifying TB. The purpose of this report is to review and critically appraise
                the evidence-based guidelines regarding interventions for the identification of
                TB. This report is part of series of evidence reviews on TB guidelines and can
                serve as a guidance document to identify which guidelines include
                recommendations for specific identification methods and specific populations of
                interest, and the strength of the guidelines. This report does not cover
                recommendations regarding the identification of multi-drug resistant TB, or
                diagnostic tests in people with HIV or conditions that compromise the immune
                system, as these topics are covered in separate reports.(,) This report focuses
                on identification strategies and diagnostic tests for the identification of LTBI
                and active TB diagnosis. This report is a component of a larger CADTH Condition
                Level Review on TB. A condition level review is an assessment that incorporates
                all aspects of a condition, from prevention, detection, treatment, and
                management. For more information on CADTH’s Condition Level Review of TB, please

            <abstract>
                tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious
                disease caused by the bacteria mycobacterium tuberculosis. It is transmitted
                between humans primarily through aerosols that are generated through the
                forceful expiration of air (e.g., coughing, sneezing). Infection with M.
                tuberculosis does not always result in active TB disease, producing instead an
                asymptomatic latent TB infection. People with latent TB cannot spread the
                disease to others, but they can develop active TB disease. Symptoms of active TB
                disease include a bad cough, fever, and weight loss. The current treatment for
                active and latent TB involve long courses of antibiotic treatments, which often
                include more than one drug.(,) Incomplete treatment adherence is a major
                challenge of TB treatment, and failing to complete the treatment can result in
                persistent disease or the development of drug-resistant TB. One of the
                strategies for improving adherence is directly observed or direct observational
                therapy (DOT).(–) Standard DOT is conducted in person and involves directly
                watching the patient swallow each dose of medication. Compared to
                self-administered therapy, DOT has been shown to be effective, however, it is
                very resource intensive for both the patient and the health care service. It is
                unclear who should provide DOT, and whether this person needs to be a health
                care professional (e.g., public health nurse) or whether lay people can also
                provide DOT (e.g., family, community members). It is also unclear whether the
                location where DOT is administered is important. DOT could involve the patients
                returning to a health care facility every day (e.g., TB clinic, hospital), but
                it is also possible that DOT can occur at other locations (e.g., workplace,
                home). Alternatively, thanks to advances in technology, video observational
                therapy (VOT) is possible, where patients are observed taking their medication
                over video (often facilitated through a smart phone). VOT can occur in real time
                (i.e., synchronous VOT), or patients can record and submit videos (i.e.,
                asynchronous VOT). VOT could help minimize resources for providing DOT, but
                there are some privacy concerns with VOT due to the technology. The purpose of
                the current report is to summarize and critically appraise the relevant evidence
                regarding the provision of DOT for the treatment of TB. Additionally,
                evidence-based guidelines with recommendations regarding the use of DOT for the
                treatment of TB will be reviewed. This report is a component of a larger CADTH
                Condition Level Review on TB. A condition level review is an assessment that
                incorporates all aspects of a condition, from prevention, detection, treatment,
                and management. For more information on CADTH’s Condition Level Review of TB,

                12:00 pm - 12:45 pm INTRODUCTION: tuberculosis, although rare in this region,
                should be suspected in patients who present with fevers, cough, weight loss,
                night sweats and has associated risk factors. We present a case of massive
                pulmonary embolism in a patient who was concomitantly diagnosed with active
                tuberculosis. CASE PRESENTATION: An 81-year-old female initially presented to
                her primary care physician with one month of bilateral leg swelling and a week
                of dyspnea. She was subsequently sent to the emergency department at an outside
                hospital where she was found to be hypoxic and hypotensive. A CT chest and lower
                extremity dopplers were done, which demonstrated a massive pulmonary embolus and
                bilateral lower extremity DVTs. She was given tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)
                and ultimately transferred to our hospital for further management. During her
                stay, her imaging was reviewed which showed innumerable, bilateral micronodules
                with upper lobe predominance and peri-bronchovascular coalescence. Autoimmune
                workup, including ANA, CCP, RF were negative. Infectious workup, including HIV,
                streptococcal pneumoniae antigen, legionella antigen, cryptococcal antigen,
                galactomannan, and beta glucan, were all negative. AFB stains and culture were
                sent, and they were positive for mycobacterium tuberculosis. Ultimately, the
                patient&apos;s respiratory status continued to decline, and the family decided
                to pursue comfort care. DISCUSSION: About 100,000 deaths occur annually in the
                United States due to pulmonary emboli (PE). General risk factors for development
                of PE are underlying hypercoagulable disorders, cancer, trauma, recent surgery,
                immobilization.2 An uncommon cause of PE is tuberculosis. While it is one of the
                most common infections worldwide, it is estimated that the general risk of
                developing a venous thromboembolism in the setting of tuberculosis is about 2%.1
                The underlying mechanism of hypercoagulation is currently unknown but suspected
                to be due to a pro-inflammatory state as a result of tuberculosis infection. One
                study that investigated various coagulation factors in 75 patients with active
                TB, either primary or recurrent, found that this subset of patients has elevated
                plasma levels of thrombin-antithrombin complexes, D-dimer and fibrinogen as well
                as reduced levels of antithrombin, protein C activity, free protein S and
                protein C inhibitor when compared to the general population.3 Interestingly,
                these findings did not necessarily correlate with the level of plasma TB
                biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS: Our patient had a unique presentation of active
                tuberculosis in the setting of a massive pulmonary embolus. While pulmonary
                emboli are common, it is important to recognize uncommon causes in patients with
                no known common risk factors. REFERENCE #1: 1. Gupta A, Mrigpuri P, Faye A,

                Objective: In rheumatic diseases, it
                has been reported that the risk of developing tuberculosis increases 1.6 to 25.1
                times after the use of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) blocker treatment.
                Therefore, latent tuberculosis infection is very important in patients who use
                TNF-α blocker drugs. In this study, it was aimed to investigate the diagnostic
                value of interferon-gamma release assay before TNF-α blocker therapy in the
                diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection in pediatric patients with chronic
                inflammatory disease resistant to standard treatments and with TNF-indication.
                Material and Methods: In this study, 93 pediatric patients with chronic
                rheumatic inflammatory disease, who would be started on anti-TNF therapy and
                investigated for latent tuberculosis infection, and 69 control patients without
                chronic disease, who were examined for any reason, were retrospectively
                analyzed. QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus test, which is a commercial test based on
                interferon-gamma QuantiFERON-ELISA tech-nique, and tuberculin skin test were
                applied to all patients examined. Results: In the patient group examined in this
                study, 19 (20.4%) of 93 patients were positive for tuberculin skin test and four
                (4.3%) for inter-feron-gamma release test. There were 17 (18.2%) patients with
                positive tuberculin skin test results and negative interferon-gamma release test
                results, and two (2.2%) patients with negative tuberculin skin test results and
                positive interferon-gamma release test results. There were two (2.2%) patients
                with positive interferon-gamma release test and tuberculin skin test. Tuberculin
                skin test was negative in all 69 patients in the control group, and
                interferon-gamma release assay results were positive in three (4.3%) of them. In
                this study, the agreement between the tuberculin skin test and the
                interferon-gamma release assay was found to be weak (p&lt; 0.01). Isoniazid
                prophylaxis was started before biologic agent treatment in 19 (%20.4) patients
                whose tuberculin skin test was found to be 5 mm and above in 93 patients who
                were screened with tuberculin skin test and interferon-γ release assay. No
                active tuberculosis development was detected in the 2.5-year follow-up of 19
                patients who were included in the study and diagnosed with latent tuberculosis
                infection. Conclusion: All patients planned to receive TNF-alpha blockers should
                be screened for tuberculosis before treatment. In the light of current
                guidelines, patients should be screened for tuberculosis infection with contact
                history, symptoms, physical examination, chest X-ray, and tuber-culin skin test
                and/or interferon gamma release assay. Although some studies have shown that
                IGST may be more useful for LTBI screening before TNF-α blocker treatment, this
                conclusion could not be reached in our study either.

                A cross-sectional study to assess
                rates of tuberculin skin test (TST) among health care workers (HCW) and
                non-health care workers (nHCW) was conducted in a hospital of the Veneto Region,
                Italy. The HCW group (n. 1315, mean age 34.6 years old) and the nHCW group (n.
                138, mean age 33.7 years old) were stratified by age and age of employment and
                compared by means of a Χ2 test. A positive TST was found in 296 (22.5%) HCW and
                in 17 (12.3%) nHCW (Χ2 = 7.674, p &lt; 0.01). The number of positive TST
                subjects increased in both groups by age, but a statistically significant
                difference between HCW and nHCW was only found in the &lt; 30 years old group.
                On the contrary, no difference was observed between the two groups by age of
                employment. The study results show that age is the main factor for mycobacterium
                tuberculosis infection and they do not support the hypothesis that HCW are at an
                increased risk for occupational MT infection.

            <abstract>
                tuberculosis is a treatable but
                severe disease caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Recent statistics by
                international health organizations estimate the Mtb exposure to have reached
                over two billion individuals. Delay in disease diagnosis could be fatal,
                especially to the population at risk, such as individuals with compromised
                immune systems. Intelligent decision systems (IDS) provide a promising tool to
                expedite discovery of biomarkers, and to boost their impact on earlier
                prediction of the likelihood of the disease onset. A novel IDS (iTB) is designed
                that integrates results from molecular medicine and systems biology of Mtb
                infection to estimate model parameters for prediction of the dynamics of the
                gene networks in Mtb-infected laboratory animals. The mouse model identifies a
                number of genes whose expressions could be significantly altered during the TB
                activation. Among them, a much smaller number of the most informative genes for
                prediction of the onset of TB are selected using a modified version of Empirical
                Risk Minimization as in Vapnik&apos;s statistical learning theory. A hybrid
                intelligent system is designed to take as input the mRNA abundance at a near
                genome-size from the individual-to-be-tested, measured 3-4 times. The algorithms
                determine if that individual is at risk of the onset of the disease based on our
                current analysis of mRNA data, and to predict the values of the biomarkers for a
                future period (of up to 60 days for mice; this may differ for humans). An early
                warning sign allows conducting gene expression analysis during the activation
                which aims to find key genes that are expressed. With rapid advances in low-cost
                genome-based diagnosis, this IDS architecture provides a promising platform to
                advance Personalized Health Care based on sequencing the genome and microarray
                analysis of samples obtained from individuals at risk. The novelty of the design
                of iTB lies in the integration of the IDS design principles and the solution of
                the biological problems hand-in-hand, so as to provide an AI framework for
                biologically better-targeted personalized prevention/treatment for the high-risk
                groups. The iTB design applies in more generality, and provides the potential
                for extension of our AI-approach to personalized-medicine to prevent other
                public health pandemics. © 2011 IFIP International Federation for Information

                tuberculosis prevention involves not
                only the diagnosis and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection but also
                prevention of progression of latent tuberculosis into active disease, spread of
                the tubercle bacilli to other persons from an infectious host, and development
                of drug resistance and the spread of multi-drug-resistant mycobacterium
                tuberculosis. As well, in this new age of globalization, where movement of
                population is at its highest level yet, prevention can also be seen as a more
                global approach to tuberculosis control worldwide. This article focuses on
                preventing TB on a personal level by detecting and treating latent infection,
                thereby reducing the risk of development of active disease, which in turn should
                impact on population prevention by reducing the rate of contagious cases. On the
                community prevention level, it mentions contact tracing, outbreak management,
                and public health intervention. It also discusses vaccination and the prevention
                of drug resistance, since these have an impact on disease prevention. © 2017

                BACKGROUND: The tracing and
                screening of people who have had contact with an active case of tuberculosis
                (TB) is an important element of TB control strategies. OBJECTIVES: This study
                aimed to carry out a review of evidence regarding TB contact tracing, with a
                particular emphasis on research that was applicable to TB contact tracing in
                specific population groups in the UK. DESIGN: An evidence synthesis of
                literature of any study design on TB contact tracing in developed countries was
                carried out. SETTING: Any setting. POPULATION: Individuals found to have active
                TB disease, and people who have come into contact with them. INTERVENTIONS:
                Contact-tracing investigations. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Any outcome related to TB
                infection, contact investigations and/or the views of staff, people with TB
                disease, or their contacts. DATA SOURCES: Searches for research published 1995
                onwards were undertaken in the following databases: MEDLINE via Ovid SP, EMBASE
                via Ovid SP, EconLit via Ovid SP, PsycINFO via Ovid SP, Social Policy and
                Practice via Ovid SP, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature
                via EBSCOhost, Science and Social Science Citation Indices via Web of Science
                and The Cochrane Library via Wiley Online Library. REVIEW METHODS: The study
                comprised a review of TB contact tracing in specific population groups and a
                review in wider populations. A narrative synthesis was completed and a logic
                model was developed from the literature. RESULTS: There were 112 articles in the
                review: 23 related to specific populations and 89 related to wider populations.
                The literature was of limited quality, with much general description of
                investigations. We identified only two (uncontrolled) studies that could be
                considered evaluative. Although the limitations of the evidence should be
                recognised, the review suggested the following: the value of a location-based
                approach, working with local communities and the media, partnership working,
                using molecular epidemiological testing, ensuring adequate systems and
                addressing fear of stigma. The literature on investigations for specific
                populations has much concordance with that reporting findings from wider
                population groups. The recognised limitations of conventional investigation
                methods may, however, be exacerbated in specific populations. LIMITATIONS: The
                English-language inclusion criterion may have limited the breadth of countries
                represented. A meta-analysis was not possible owing to the nature of the
                literature. Relevant studies may have been missed by our searches, which used
                terminology relating to contact tracing rather than to active case finding or
                screening. CONCLUSIONS: The review identified a sizeable volume of literature
                relating to contact investigations. However, it is currently predominantly
                descriptive, with little evaluative work underpinning investigations in either
                specific or wider populations. Our findings are, therefore, based on limited
                evidence. Further research is required if robust conclusions are to be made.
                FUTURE WORK: Research should further explore the development of measures that
                can be used to compare the effectiveness of different contact investigations, in
                studies using evaluative designs. FUNDING: The National Institute for Health
                Research Health Services and Delivery Research programme.&#xD;The evidence on
                interventions to improve contact tracing for TB was primarily descriptive rather
                than evaluative, so a high priority for future research is empirical
                evaluation.&#xD;eng

                As the world focuses on the COVID-19
                pandemic, it is important not to lose sight of other infectious and
                noninfectious diseases that continue to exact a major toll on the health of
                children. Childhood tuberculosis (TB) stands among the most serious of these,
                with an estimated 1.1 million cases of TB disease and more than 200,000 TB
                deaths in children less than 15 years of age in 2020 [1]. The COVID-19 pandemic
                has markedly decreased the global capacity to diagnose and treat TB in children
                and adults, resulting in decreased numbers of persons treated for TB in 2020,
                and the first increase in TB mortality in more than a decade [1]. Increased
                transmission from adults with untreated infectious TB is anticipated to reverse
                the previous slow but steady decline in TB in both children and adults. As
                global efforts to manage the COVID-19 pandemic continue, it is important to take
                stock of the state of childhood TB and evaluate what needs to be done, not just
                to reach the rate of progress that existed prior to the pandemic, but to advance
                efforts on multiple fronts to reduce morbidity and mortality from TB in
                children. In this series of articles, experts in childhood TB will address
                several aspects of the TB epidemic in children, including the interaction of TB
                with both HIV infection and with COVID-19, medication interactions and
                adherence, diagnostics, new treatments, systems and programmatic approaches to
                TB care and services, and vaccine development. These articles will identify the
                challenges in controlling childhood TB in 2022 and beyond, and highlight areas
                that can accelerate the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of this
                longstanding global pandemic.

                tuberculosis (TB) is a chronic
                communicable disease that primarily affects the respiratory system. It is caused
                by infection with mycobacterium tuberculosis, a species of bacteria in the
                Mycobacteriaceae family. As much as 25% of the global population is estimated to
                have TB infection, although only a small portion of infected individuals are ill
                as a result of the infection. The incidence of TB varies greatly by country. For
                example, the rate of active TB in Canada is approximately 4.9 per 100,000
                population, although this rate is considerably higher in Canadian-born
                Indigenous populations (21.5 per 100,000 population). By comparison, the
                incidence of active TB in the Philippines, which is classified as a high-burden
                country, is estimated to be 554 per 100,000 population. There are two stages to
                TB: 1) latent TB infection, and 2) active TB infection. latent TB typically
                occurs immediately following exposure to the bacteria. Although an individual
                who has latent TB infection will not exhibit any symptoms and they are not
                considered contagious, there are dormant bacteria residing in their lungs. If
                latent TB is left untreated it can progress to active infection. Those who have
                active infection are contagious and may show symptoms such as coughing, chest
                pain, unexpected weight loss, loss of appetite, night sweats, fever, fatigue,
                and chills. Without medical intervention (e.g., rifampin, isoniazid,
                pyrazinamide, ethambutol), TB can be fatal. Individuals with who have HIV, are
                transplant recipients, are on biologic therapies (e.g., TNF [tumour necrosis
                factor] inhibitors), and those who have impaired or compromised immune systems
                for other reasons are at an increased risk for latent TB reactivation. There is
                no established gold standard technique for diagnosing latent TB infection. The
                most commonly used screening methods are the tuberculin skin test (TST) and
                interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs); however, these diagnostic tools have
                limited sensitivity and specificity. The objective of the current report is to
                evaluate the evidence regarding the diagnostic accuracy and clinical utility of
                the TST for patients with compromised immunity prior to initiating biologic
                treatment. Additionally, evidence-based guidelines regarding testing for latent
                TB infection in patients with compromised immunity prior to initiating biologic
                therapy will be reviewed. This report expands upon a previously completed CADTH
                report (list of references). This report is a component of a larger CADTH
                Condition Level Review on TB. A condition level review is an assessment that
                incorporates all aspects of a condition, from prevention, detection, treatment,
                and management. For more information on CADTH’s Condition Level Review of TB,

                Despite 90 years of vaccination and
                60 years of chemotherapy, tuberculosis (TB) remains the world’s leading cause of
                death from an infectious agent, exceeding human immunodeficiency virus/acquired
                immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) for the first time (WHO 2015b, 2016a). The
                World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that there are about 10.4 million new
                cases and 1.8 million deaths from TB each year. One-third of these new cases
                (about 3 million) remain unknown to the health system, and many are not
                receiving proper treatment. tuberculosis is an infectious bacterial disease
                caused by mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), which is transmitted between humans
                through the respiratory route and most commonly affects the lungs, but can
                damage any tissue. Only about 10 percent of individuals infected with Mtb
                progress to active TB disease within their lifetime; the remainder of persons
                infected successfully contain their infection. One of the challenges of TB is
                that the pathogen persists in many infected individuals in a latent state for
                many years and can be reactivated to cause disease. The risk of progression to
                TB disease after infection is highest soon after the initial infection and
                increases dramatically for persons co-infected with HIV/AIDS or other
                immune-compromising conditions. Treatment of TB disease requires multiple drugs
                for many months. These long drug regimens are challenging for both patients and
                health care systems, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs),
                where the disease burden often far outstrips local resources. In some areas, the
                incidence of drug-resistant TB, requiring even longer treatment regimens with
                drugs that are more expensive and difficult to tolerate, is increasing.
                Diagnosis in LMICs is made primarily by microscopic examination of stained
                smears of sputum of suspected patients; however, smear microscopy is capable of
                detecting only 50–60 percent of all cases (smear-positive). More sensitive
                methods of diagnosing TB and detecting resistance to drugs have recently become
                available, although they are more expensive. The time between the onset of
                disease and when diagnosis is made and treatment is initiated is often
                protracted, and such delays allow the transmission of disease. Although bacille
                Calmette–Guérin (bcg) remains the world’s most widely used vaccine, its
                effectiveness is geographically highly variable and incomplete. Modeling
                suggests that more effective vaccines will likely be needed to drive
                tuberculosis toward elimination in high-incidence settings. The basic strategy
                to combat TB has been, for 40 years, to provide diagnosis and treatment to
                individuals who are ill and who seek care at a health facility. The premise is
                that, if patients with active disease are cured, mortality will disappear,
                prevalence of disease will decline, transmission will decline, and therefore
                incidence should decline. The reality in many countries is more complex, and
                overall the decline in incidence (only about 1.5 percent per year) has been
                unacceptably slow. Chemotherapy for TB is one of the most cost-effective of all
                health interventions (McKee and Atun 2006). This evidence has been central to
                the global promotion of the WHO and Stop TB Partnership policy of directly
                observed therapy, short course (DOTS) strategy, the package of measures
                combining best practices in the diagnosis and care of patients with TB (UN
                General Assembly 2000). The DOTS strategy to control tuberculosis promotes
                standardized treatment, with supervision and patient support that may include,
                but is far broader than, direct observation of therapy (DOT), where a health
                care worker personally observes the patient taking the medication (WHO 2013a).
                Thanks in part to these efforts and national and international investments, much
                progress has been made in TB control over the past several decades. Between 1990
                and 2010, absolute global mortality from TB declined 18.7 percent, from 1.47
                million to 1.20 million (Lozano and others 2012) and by 22 percent between 2000
                and 2015 (WHO 2016a). By 2015, an estimated 49 million lives had been saved (WHO
                2016a). The internationally agreed targets for TB, embraced in the United
                Nations (UN) Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), sought “to halt and reverse
                the expanding incidence of tuberculosis by 2015,” and this target has been met
                to some extent in all six WHO regions and in most, but not all, of the world’s
                22 high-burden countries (WHO 2014c). Despite progress, major gaps persist.
                Although the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) seek to end the tuberculosis
                epidemic altogether (WHO 2015a, 2015c), the decline in incidence has been
                disappointing. One of every three TB patients remains “unknown to the health
                system,” many are undiagnosed and untreated, and case detection and treatment
                success rates remain too low in the high-burden countries. Ominously, rates of
                multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB—defined as resistance to the two major TB drugs,
                isoniazid and rifampicin—are rising globally (WHO 2011a) with the emergence of
                extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB, resistant to many second-line drugs, as
                well as strains resistant to all current drugs (Dheda and others 2014; Udwadia
                and others 2012; Uplekar and others 2015). These are now primarily the result of
                transmission rather than inadequate treatment (Shah and others 2017). Moreover,
                the TB problem has become more pressing because of co-infection with HIV/AIDS.
                While globally HIV/AIDS and TB co-infection represents only 11 percent of the
                total TB burden, in some areas of Sub-Saharan Africa with a high burden of TB,
                as many as three-quarters of TB patients are co-infected with HIV/AIDS. In those
                countries, efforts to control TB are overwhelmed by the rising number of TB
                cases occurring in parallel with the HIV/AIDS epidemic. And after decades of
                steady decline, the incidence of TB is also increasing in some high-income
                countries (HICs), mainly as the result of outbreaks in vulnerable groups (WHO
                2015b). If the ultimate goal of controlling an infectious disease is to
                interrupt transmission, turning the tide on TB will require early and accurate
                case detection, rapid commencement of and adherence to effective treatment that
                prevents transmission, and, where possible, preventive treatment of latent TB.
                It is universally understood that new strategies and more effective tools and
                interventions will be required to reach post-2015 targets (Bloom and Atun 2016;
                WHO 2015a). These interventions must be not only cost-effective, but also
                affordable and capable of having an impact on a very large scale. TB control
                will need three new advances—development of new point-of-care diagnostics, more
                effective drug regimens to combat drug-susceptible and drug-resistant TB, and
                more effective vaccines. As argued in this chapter, these require new strategies
                and tools that include moving away from the traditional DOTS passive case
                finding and toward more active case finding in high-burden regions; service
                delivery that is targeted to the most vulnerable populations and integrated with
                other services, especially HIV/AIDS services; and care that is based at the
                primary health care and community levels. Specifically, in high-burden
                countries, many individuals with TB are asymptomatic, such that waiting for
                patients to become sick enough to seek care has not been sufficient to reduce
                transmission and incidence markedly (Bates and others 2012; Mao and others 2014;
                Willingham and others 2001; Wood and others 2007). A more active and aggressive
                approach is needed that tackles health system barriers to effective TB control.
                The strategies for controlling TB recommended by the WHO have evolved
                significantly over time. In the early formulations, the central tenets of the
                global TB control strategy were clinical and programmatic in nature, focusing
                principally on the delivery of standardized drug regimens; the underlying
                assumption was that the problem could be solved largely by existing biomedical
                tools (Atun, McKee, and others 2005; Schouten and others 2011). Yet, in many
                LMICs, health system weaknesses in governance, financing, health workforce,
                procurement and supply chain management, and information systems have impeded TB
                control (Elzinga, Raviglione, and Maher 2004; Marais and others 2010; Travis and
                others 2004) and not been adequately addressed by TB control efforts. The
                current global TB strategy, formulated as the End TB Strategy, is the most
                comprehensive ever, with three major pillars: Integrated, patient-centered care
                and prevention. Social and political action to address determinants of disease.
                Recognition of the urgent need for research to provide new tools (WHO 2015a).
                Health systems are important and need to be strengthened. As with other health
                interventions, the success of tuberculosis treatment and control in a country is
                often determined by the strength of its health system (McKee and Atun 2006; WHO
                2003). A health system can be defined in many ways, perhaps best as “all the
                activities whose primary purpose is to promote, restore, or maintain health”
                (WHO 2000, 5). In a sense, the major risk factor for acquiring TB is breathing.
                Thus, people of all social and economic statuses are at risk. While TB
                disproportionately affects the poor, the narrative that TB is a disease only of
                the poor is misleading and counterproductive, if it leads either to further
                stigmatization of the disease or to the view that middle- and high-income
                countries need not worry about the disease. In the case of co-infection with
                HIV/AIDS, evidence suggests that HIV/AIDS is often more prevalent in better-off
                populations in Africa that suffer high rates of TB. The analytical framework
                underlying this chapter defines key functions of the health system, ultimate
                goals, and contextual factors that affect the health system (figure 11.1). It
                builds on the WHO framework (WHO 2000) as well as health system frameworks
                developed by Frenk (1994), Hsiao and Heller (2007), and Roberts and others
                (2004), and national accounts (OECD, Eurostat, and WHO 2011). It also draws on
                earlier studies by Atun (2012); Atun and Coker (2008); Atun, Samyshkin, and
                others (2006); Samb and others (2009); and Swanson and others (2012). The four
                key health system functions represented in the framework are as follows:
                Governance and organization. The policy and regulatory environment; stewardship
                and regulatory functions of the ministry of health and its relation to other
                levels of the health system; and structural arrangements for insurers and
                purchasers, health care providers, and market regulators. Financing. The way
                funds are collected, funds and risks are pooled, finances are allocated, and
                health care providers are remunerated. Resource management. The way
                resources—physical, human, and intellectual—are generated and allocated,
                including their geographic and needs-based allocation. Service delivery. Both
                population- and individual-level public health interventions and health care
                services provided in community, primary health care, hospitals, and other health
                institutions. Each of these functions is influenced by the economic,
                demographic, legal, cultural, and political context. As the framework suggests,
                health system goals include better health, financial protection, and user
                satisfaction. Personal health services and public health interventions should be
                organized to achieve an appropriate balance of equity (including reducing
                out-of-pocket [OOP] expenditures and impoverishment of individuals and
                families), efficiency, effectiveness (that is, the extent to which interventions
                are evidence based and safe), responsiveness, equity, and client satisfaction
                (as perceived by the users of services). This chapter is organized as follows.
                First, we provide a detailed discussion of the global burden of disease and
                clinical context, followed by a review of approaches to diagnosis, treatment,
                and prevention. The aim throughout is to approach TB through a health system
                lens and, in the latter part of the chapter, to provide recommendations for
                improving delivery strategies and strengthening health systems, including care,
                supply chain, and information systems. Because the current tools for combating
                TB are seriously inadequate, we conclude with sections on critical research and
                development and economic analyses of new interventions for diagnosis, treatment,
                and vaccines. Throughout, emphasis is placed on data or modeling of the economic
                costs and benefits, where available, of current or possible future interventions
                to combat this disease. The chapter recommends moving toward active case finding
                in high-burden countries; greater investments in health systems; community-based
                rather than hospital-based service delivery; and greater support for research on
                new tools—that is, developing better diagnostics, treatment regimens, and
                vaccines. Most of these approaches were included in earlier WHO policies, but
                were not emphasized. They are now part of the WHO’s End TB Strategy, with which
                this report is fully consistent (WHO 2015a, 2015c).

            <abstract>
                In the present study, tuberculosis
                specialists were surveyed to rate the most effective strategies to eliminate TB
                as a public health problem by 2050. Then were investigated the most promising
                emerging technologies for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of
                tuberculosis (TB) expected to reach the market by 2035. This Technology
                Foresight study was specifically carried out by means of a web survey closed
                questionnaire, which was sent to 29,988 TB specialists worldwide. Of these,
                2,657 answers were obtained and analysed. Respondents had demonstrated a high
                level of academic training (PhD), more than 10 years of professional experience,
                and a great diversity of both areas of knowledge and geographic reach. In the
                view of experts, the strategies with the greatest potential impact on epidemic
                TB were a) shorter time between diagnosis and start of treatment of DS and
                MDR-TB; b) strengthening tuberculosis control actions in the most vulnerable
                populations; c) shorter and less expensive regimens for drug resistant
                MDR/XDR-TB. Regarding the strategies with the highest potential for eliminating
                TB, our data suggests that the biomedical paradigm is the strongest among the
                specialists. The most promising technologies expected to reach the market by
                2035 selected by the specialists were: (1) new drugs of known chemical classes
                or new chemical classes; (2) new point-of-care diagnostic tests for DS-TB, drug
                resistant or multidrug resistant (MDR/XDR)-TB and TB Infection (TBI). We
                contribute by discussing the most promising technologies and strategies for the
                elimination of TB in light of social determinants of health models and
                forecasting studies. We conclude by suggesting that the expected emerging
                technologies ongoing development will not suffice to end TB by 2050.

                Background The evolution of
                tuberculosis (TB) disease during the clinical latency period remains
                incompletely understood. Methods 250 HIV-uninfected, adult household contacts of
                rifampicin-resistant TB with a negative symptom screen underwent baseline
                18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission and computed tomography (PET/CT),
                repeated in 112 after 5-15 months. Following South African and WHO guidelines,
                participants did not receive preventive therapy. All participants had intensive
                baseline screening with spontaneous, followed by induced, sputum sampling and
                were then observed for an average of 4.7 years for culture-positive disease.
                Baseline PET/CT abnormalities were evaluated in relation to culture-positive
                disease. Results At baseline, 59 (23.6%) participants had lung PET/CT findings
                consistent with TB of which 29 (11.6%) were defined as Subclinical TB, and 30
                (12%) Subclinical TB-inactive. A further 83 (33.2%) had other lung parenchymal
                abnormalities and 108 (43.2%) had normal lungs. Over 1107-person years of
                follow-up 14 cases of culture-positive TB were diagnosed. Six cases were
                detected by intensive baseline screening, all would have been missed by the
                South African symptom-based screening strategy and only one detected by a
                WHO-recommended chest X-Ray screening strategy. Those with baseline Subclinical
                TB lesions on PET/CT were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with
                culture-positive TB over the study period, compared to those with normal lung
                parenchyma (10/29 [34.5%] vs 2/108 [1.9%], Hazard Ratio 22.37 [4.89-102.47,
                p&lt;0.001]). Conclusions These findings challenge the latent/active TB paradigm
                demonstrating that subclinical disease exists up to 4 years prior to
                microbiological detection and/or symptom onset. There are important implications
                for screening and management of TB.

                Background. Depression is common
                among persons with TB and associated with poor clinical outcomes. However,
                little is known about the relationship between latent TB infection (LTBI) and
                depression. Here, we assessed the association between LTBI and depressive
                symptoms among household contacts (HHCs) of patients receiving TB treatment.
                Methods. We enrolled 1,009 HHCs of 307 patients receiving TB treatment in Lima,
                Peru, 2016-2018. We assessed HHC LTBI status at enrollment using interferon
                gamma release assay (IGRA). Depressive symptoms were assessed at baseline and 12
                months later using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) using a cutoff of
                ≥5. We used logistic regression to estimate the odds ratio for PHQ-9 ≥5
                comparing HHCs with and without baseline LTBI. Results. Among 921 HHCs, 378
                (41.0%) had LTBI at baseline, and 70 (12.4%) of 563 HHCs had PHQ-9 ≥5. Compared
                to HHCs without LTBI at enrollment, those with LTBI had almost two times the
                odds of PHQ-9 ≥5 at follow-up after controlling for potential confounders
                (adjusted OR, 1.93, 95% CI, 1.09-3.39); this association was driven by greater
                severities of depressive symptoms. Conclusion. HHCs with LTBI had increased odds
                of depressive symptoms one year later. This at-risk population may benefit from
                mental health screening and interventions integrated within TB programs.

                Background: Traditional
                understanding of the risk of progression from mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)
                infection to tuberculosis (TB) disease overlooks nuance across a spectrum of
                disease. Methods: We developed a deterministic model of Mtb infection and
                minimal (pathological damage but not infectious), subclinical (infectious but no
                reported symptoms), and clinical (infectious and symptomatic) TB disease,
                informed by a rigorous evaluation of data from a systematic review of TB natural
                history. Using a Bayesian approach, we calibrated the model to data from
                historical cohorts that followed tuberculin-negative individuals to tuberculin
                conversion and TB disease, as well as data from cohorts that followed
                progression and regression between disease states, disease state prevalence
                ratios, disease duration, and mortality. We estimated incidence, pathways, and
                ten-year outcomes following Mtb infection for a simulated cohort. Results: 90.8%
                (95% uncertainty interval, UI, 90.2-91.3) of individuals self-cleared within 10
                years of infection, while 9.3% (95% UI 8.4-10.0) progressed to TB disease. Of
                those, 68.1% (95% UI 65.1-71.1) developed infectious disease, and 32.7% (95% UI
                29.7-35.7) progressed to clinical disease. While 93% of progression to minimal
                disease occurred within two years of infection, only 63% and 38% of subclinical
                and clinical disease, respectively, occurred within this period. Multiple
                progression pathways from infection were necessary to calibrate the model, and
                48.8% (95% UI 45.0-52.6) of those who developed infectious disease undulated
                between disease states. Conclusions: We identified highly heterogeneous pathways
                across disease states after Mtb infection, highlighting the need for clearly
                defined disease thresholds to inform more effective prevention and treatment
                efforts to end TB.

            <abstract>
                With the large global burden of
                latent tuberculosis (TB) infection (LTBI), screening for LTBI for various
                reasons has become standard practice including the low-prevalence settings. The
                results showed acceptable intra- and inter-run precision as well as cutoff
                verification across the two analyzers at the afore-mentioned levels (Table 1).
                Overall, the LIAISON QFT-Plus showed better inter- and intra-run precision
                compared with QFT-Plus when comparing low-positive TB1/2 samples; however,
                coefficient of variation (CVs) less than 20% are generally acceptable for any
                automated test. Cutoff verification showed CVs for QFT-Plus TB1 and TB2,
                QFT-Plus LIAISON TB1 and TB2 of 5.2%, 4.1%, 5.2%, 5.4%, respectively,
                demonstrating robustness around the cutoffs. Altogether, the two methods were
                highly comparable. LIAISON QFT-Plus is a suitable alternative to batch testing
                (e.g., using DSX) in high-volume laboratories.

            <abstract>
                Interferon-gamma release assay and
                tuberculin skin test use is limited by costly sundries and cross-reactivity with
                non-tuberculous mycobacteria and Bacille Calmette-Guérin (bcg) vaccination
                respectively. We investigated the Monocyte to Lymphocyte ratio (MLR) as a
                biomarker to overcome these limitations and for use in monitoring response to
                tuberculosis preventive therapy (TPT). We conducted a cross-sectional and nested
                prospective observational study among asymptomatic adults living with human
                Immuno-deficiency Virus (HIV) in Kampala, Uganda. Complete blood count (CBC) and
                QuantiFERON-TB® Gold-plus were measured at baseline and CBC repeated at three
                months. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify factors
                associated with a high MLR and decline in MLR. We recruited 110 adults living
                with HIV and on antiretroviral therapy, of which 82.5% (85/110) had suppressed
                viral loads, 71.8% (79/110) were female, and 73.6% (81/110) had a bcg scar. The
                derived MLR diagnostic cut-off was 0.35, based on which the MLR sensitivity,
                specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were
                12.8%, 91.6%, 45.5%, and 65.7% respectively. The average MLR declined from 0.212
                (95% CI: 0.190 – 0.235) at baseline to 0.182 (95% CI: 0.166 – 0.198) after three
                months of TPT. A viral load of &gt;50 copies/ml (aOR, 5.67 [1.12-28.60]) was
                associated with a high MLR while that of &lt;50 copies/ml (aOR, 0.07
                [0.007-0.832]) was associated with a decline in MLR. MLR was highly specific in
                diagnosing latent TB and declined significantly following three months of TPT.
                Implications of a high MLR and decline in MLR after TPT need further evaluation
                in a larger cohort.

            <abstract>
                Old people are at high risk of
                developing and dying from pulmonary infections like tuberculosis (TB), but they
                are few studies and particularly in Hispanics. To address these gaps, we sought
                to identify host factors associated with TB and adverse treatment outcomes in
                old Hispanics by conducting a secondary analysis of TB surveillance data from
                Tamaulipas, Mexico (2006-2013; n=8,381). Multivariable logistic regressions were
                assessed for the elderly (ELD, ≥65 years) when compared to young (YA, 18 to 39
                years) and middle-aged adults (MAA, 40 to 64 years). We found that the ELD had
                features associated with a less complicated TB (e.g. less extrapulmonary TB,
                abandoning of treatment or having drug resistant TB), and yet, were more likely
                to die during TB treatment (adj-OR 3.9, 95% 2.5, 5.25). Among the elderly,
                excess alcohol use and low BMI increased their odds of death, while diabetes and
                bcg vaccination were protective. These data suggest that old people share some,
                but not all the risk factors for adverse TB treatment outcomes, when compared
                with younger adults. Furthermore, even though old age in itself is an important
                predictor of death during TB, the elderly are not prioritized by the World
                Health Organization for latent TB infection screening and treatment during
                contact investigations. We propose the inclusion of the elderly as a high-risk
                group in TB management guidelines.

            <abstract>
                Background: Uganda has a heavy
                double burden of tuberculosis (TB) and currently ranks among the seven highest
                TB affected countries globally. World Health Organization (WHO) recommends
                isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) for the treatment of latent TB. However, the
                adherence to IPT in military settings has not been well documented in Uganda.
                Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study among 300 HIV-positive clients on
                antiretroviral therapy (ART) at Bombo Military Hospital in Uganda. Clients were
                cumulatively recruited to a threshold sample. Data were entered and analysed
                using Epidata client v4.6.0.6 and Stata 14.0. Results: Of the 300 clients the
                prevalence of IPT was 94.7% CI (92.1-97.2); adherence to IPT was associated with
                being: aged ≥ 50 years prevalence ratio (PR) of 1.061 and a confidence interval
                (CI) of 95% (1.01-1.12); married [ PR: 1.438, CI: 95% (1.12-1.84)]; having
                social support [ PR: 1.498, CI: 95% (1.17-1.92)] and the role this played in IPT
                adherence among married participants [ PR: 0.817, CI: 95% (0.72-0.93)] are
                factors that were found to be significant. Conclusion: There is need for Bombo
                medical facility in Uganda to emphasis on strategies to improve access,
                retention and adherence to ART and IPT for young adults. Secondly, advocating
                for social support and behavioural interventions have been identified as
                requirement for improving IPT adherence among HIV positive soldiers. There is
                need for more research on the role that social support plays to reduce social
                stigma associated with HIV-positive patients. The findings for this Uganda study
                suggest that there is need to increase adherence to IPT for married participants
                living with HIV and this model could also be adopted in other resource
                constrained and low middle income countries.

                Background: tuberculosis (TB)
                disease is the leading cause of mortality among people living with the human
                immunodeficiency virus (PLHIV). Interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) are
                approved for TB infection ascertainment. However, current IGRA data on the
                prevalence of TB infection in the context of near-universal access to
                antiretroviral therapy (ART) and widespread TB preventive therapy (TPT)
                implementation are lacking. We estimated the prevalence and determinants of TB
                infection among PLHIV within a high TB and HIV burden context. Methods: This
                cross-sectional study included data from adult PLHIV age ≥ 18 years in whom
                QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus (QFT-Plus) assay, an IGRA, was performed. TB infection
                was defined as a positive or indeterminate QFT-Plus test. Participants with TB
                and those who had previously used TPT were excluded. Regression analysis was
                performed to identify independent predictors of TB infection. Results Of 121
                PLHIV with QFT-Plus test results, females were 74.4% (90/121), and the mean age
                was 38.4 (standard deviation [SD] 10.8) years. Overall, 47.9% (58/121) were
                classified as TB infection (QFT-Plus test positive and indeterminate results
                were 39.7% [48/121] and 8.3% [10/121], respectively), with mean ages of 38.7 (SD
                10.30) vs 38.2 (SD 11.3) years, respectively (p=0.602). Being obese/overweight
                (body mass index ≥25; p=0.013, adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 2.90, 95% confidence
                interval [CI] 1.25–6.74) and ART usage for &gt;3 years (p=0.013, aOR 3.99, 95%
                CI 1.55–10.28) were independently associated with TB infection. Conclusion:
                There was a high TB infection prevalence among PLHIV. A longer period of ART and
                obesity were independently associated with TB infection. The relationship
                between obesity/overweight and TB infection may be related to ART and immune
                reconstitution and requires further investigation. Given the known benefit of
                test-directed TPT among PLHIV never exposed to TPT, its clinical and cost
                implications for low and middle-income countries should be explored further.

                Mycobacterial infections, including
                tuberculosis, are a major health problem globally. Prevention and treatments of
                tuberculosis are challenging due to the poor efficacy of the current vaccine and
                the emergence of drug-resistant strains. Therefore, it is critical to increase
                our basic understanding of mycobacterial virulence strategies as well as the
                host immune response during infection in the complex in vivo setting. While
                existing infection models provide valuable tools for investigating mycobacterial
                pathogenesis, they also exhibit limitations that can be addressed by the
                development of complementary models. Here we describe recent advances to the
                murine mycobacterium marinum infection model, in which the bacteria produce a
                local infection restricted to the tail tissue. The M. marinum model has the
                advantage of mimicking some of the key hallmarks of human tuberculosis not
                replicated in the conventional murine mycobacterium tuberculosis model, such as
                the formation of granulomas with central caseating necrosis and the spontaneous
                development of a latency-like stage. Moreover, the model is non-lethal and
                enables longitudinal analysis of disease development in live animals. In this
                chapter, we report protocols to prepare infected tissue samples for detailed and
                quantitative analysis of the immune response by flow cytometry,
                immunofluorescence microscopy, RT-qPCR, ELISA, and Western blot, as well as for
                the analysis of bacterial load and localization. © 2023, The Author(s), under

                The burden of tuberculosis in New
                Zealand peaked during the Second World War with 2603 cases recorded in 1943.
                Control measures legislated for in the tuberculosis Act of 1948 played a
                significant role in bringing down the national incidence rate from over 150
                cases per 100,000 to below 10 per 100,000 by the 1990s. Today, New Zealand is
                considered to be a low TB incidence country; however, this designation can mask
                disparities in the burden of TB within the population. The Asian ethnic group
                exhibits rates of TB that are approximately 50 times greater than in the
                European or other ethnic groups. Furthermore, among New Zealand-born
                individuals, Mori experience a higher burden of TB compared to their Pākehā
                compatriots. In this chapter, factors involved in contributing to the risk of TB
                in New Zealand are examined. Data from molecular typing studies are explored to
                gain an insight into the transmission of the illness in the population. In terms
                of further measures to reduce the incidence of TB in New Zealand, newer
                technologies that specifically detect latent TB infection are required for
                pre-immigration screening from high TB burden countries. Greater utilisation of
                prophylactic therapy of latent TB infection in individuals at risk of developing
                TB could assist in preventing reactivated cases. And early detection and
                treatment of active TB cases combined with enhanced contact tracing would help
                minimise the emergence of epidemiological clusters of the disease. © Springer

                BACKGROUND: tuberculosis (TB) is a
                devastating disease for which new diagnostic tests are desperately needed.
                OBJECTIVE: To validate promising new technologies [namely whole-blood
                transcriptomics, proteomics, flow cytometry and quantitative reverse
                transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR)] and existing signatures for
                the detection of active TB in samples obtained from individuals with suspected
                active TB. DESIGN: Four substudies, each of which used samples from the biobank
                collected as part of the interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) in the Diagnostic
                Evaluation of Active TB study, which was a prospective cohort of patients
                recruited with suspected TB. SETTING: Secondary care. PARTICIPANTS: Adults aged
                ≥ 16 years presenting as inpatients or outpatients at 12 NHS hospital trusts in
                London, Slough, Oxford, Leicester and Birmingham, with suspected active TB.
                INTERVENTIONS: New tests using genome-wide gene expression microarray
                (transcriptomics), surface-enhanced laser desorption ionisation time-of-flight
                mass spectrometry/liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (proteomics), flow
                cytometry or qRT-PCR. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Area under the curve (AUC),
                sensitivity and specificity were calculated to determine diagnostic accuracy.
                Positive and negative predictive values were calculated in some cases. A
                decision tree model was developed to calculate the incremental costs and
                quality-adjusted life-years of changing from current practice to using the
                novels tests. RESULTS: The project, and four substudies that assessed the
                previously published signatures, measured each of the new technologies and
                performed a health economic analysis in which the best-performing tests were
                evaluated for cost-effectiveness. The diagnostic accuracy of the transcriptomic
                tests ranged from an AUC of 0.81 to 0.84 for detecting all TB in our cohort. The
                performance for detecting culture-confirmed TB or pulmonary TB was better than
                for highly probable TB or extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB), but was not high
                enough to be clinically useful. None of the previously described serum proteomic
                signatures for active TB provided good diagnostic accuracy, nor did the
                candidate rule-out tests. Four out of six previously described cellular immune
                signatures provided a reasonable level of diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 0.78–0.92)
                for discriminating all TB from those with other disease and latent TB infection
                in human immunodeficiency virus-negative TB suspects. Two of these assays may be
                useful in the IGRA-positive population and can provide high positive predictive
                value. None of the new tests for TB can be considered cost-effective.
                LIMITATIONS: The diagnostic performance of new tests among the HIV-positive
                population was either underpowered or not sufficiently achieved in each
                substudy. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the diagnostic performance of all previously
                identified ‘signatures’ of TB was lower than previously reported. This probably
                reflects the nature of the cohort we used, which includes the harder to diagnose
                groups, such as culture-unconfirmed TB or EPTB, which were under-represented in
                previous cohorts. FUTURE WORK: We are yet to achieve our secondary objective of
                deriving novel signatures of TB using our data sets. This was beyond the scope
                of this report. We recommend that future studies using these technologies target
                specific subtypes of TB, specifically those groups for which new diagnostic
                tests are required. FUNDING: This project was funded by the Efficacy and
                Mechanism Evaluation (EME) programme, a MRC and NIHR partnership.&#xD;None of
                the four new tests provided diagnostic accuracy at a clinically useful level,
                either for all TB cases, or for culture-positive TB.&#xD;eng

                Background: Isoniazid (INH)
                preventative therapy is recommended for people with HIV (PWH) in
                resource-constrained settings. Valid measures are needed to assess adherence. We
                aimed to examine agreement between measures overall and by level of social
                desirability. Methods: PWH with latent tuberculosis (TB) were recruited in
                Mbarara, Uganda. Past 30-day adherence was measured by the number of days with
                pill bottle openings using a medication event monitoring system (MEMS) and
                self-reported number of days pills taken. INH concentration (INH plus acetyl INH
                and their ratio) in hair samples was measured. We used Bland-Altman plots to
                examine agreement between adherence measures and calculated the area under the
                receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) to determine if INH hair
                concentration predicted optimal MEMS-measured adherence (≥90%). Results: A total
                of 301 participants enrolled; 92% were virologically suppressed, and adherence
                was high. The median (interquartile range [IQR]) number of pill bottle openings
                in 30 days was 28 (24-30) compared with 30 (28-30) via self-report. The median
                INH concentration (IQR) was 36.2 (17.2-62.4), and the INH:acetyl ratio was 2.43
                (0.99-3.92). Agreement between self-reported and MEMS adherence was greater at
                more optimal adherence levels. INH:acetyl INH ratio was not predictive of
                optimal adherence according to MEMS (AUROC, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.52-0.72) in a subset
                (n = 161). Conclusions: Lower MEMS adherence levels compared with self-report
                suggest the need for objective adherence measures. Biologic measures have
                potential, although in this study INH concentration was not predictive of MEMS
                measured adherence. More data are needed to assess the accuracy of biologic
                measures.

                Background. Patients with chronic
                kidney disease (CKD), especially end-stage kidney disease (ESKD), are at risk of
                developing tuberculosis (TB). Due to their relatively immunosuppresses
                condition, reactivation from latent TB infection (LTBI) is the core pathogenesis
                in these populations. However, the prevalence of LTBI among Thai CKD patients,
                assessed by a high sensitivity and specificity test such as interferon-gamma
                release assay (IGRA), has never been thoroughly explored. We aimed to
                investigate the prevalence and predictors for LTBI among Thai CKD patients,
                including ESKD individuals receiving renal replacement therapy (RRT) either by
                hemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD). Methods. All CKD patients who
                underwent an investigation for LTBI status at Ramathibodi hospital were
                prospectively recruited from September 2020 to November 2021 and retrospectively
                reviewed from December 2020 to November 2021. Those with positive or borderline
                IGRA results using T SPOT®.TB without clinical or radiological findings
                compatible with active TB was diagnosed with LTBI. The LTBI prevalence was
                determined by CKD staging and type of dialysis. Predictors for LTBI were
                assessed by logistic regression analysis. Results. A total of 199 CKD patients
                were enrolled; 102 prospectively and 97 retrospectively. There were 173
                evaluable patients included with a mean (SD) age of 53 (16) years, and 44% were
                male. Of those, 95 (55%) had ESKD and maintained on RRT. Overall, 39 (22.5%) CKD
                patients had LTBI with the prevalence of 25%, 12.5%, 25%, 25% and 24.2% in those
                with CKD stage 1, 2, 3a, 3b and ESKD, respectively (p=0.89). Among ESKD
                patients, those who were maintained on HD had a higher proportion of LTBI than
                those on PD (28.9% vs. 5.3%, p=0.03). In multivariate analysis, drinking alcohol
                was significantly associated with LTBI (OR 8.51; [95%CI 1.24-58.38]; p=0.029),
                and HD therapy was marginally associated with LTBI (OR 8.14; [95%CI 0.95-69.91];
                p=0.056) among ESKD patients. Conclusion. In TB endemic settings, one-fifth of
                patients with CKD and a quarter of ESKD patients could carry LTBI status.
                Alcohol consumption and HD therapy could better identify high-risk ESKD patients
                and potentially screen for LBTI.

                Background. tuberculosis (TB) is a
                chronic granulomatous inflammation usually involving the lung parenchyma and
                hilar lymph nodes. Extra-pulmonary involvement is seen in ∼20% of all TB cases.
                Developing
                tuberculosis following treatment for another primary medical condition is a rare
                occurrence. Iatrogenic literally means illness caused by medical examination or
                treatment. Mycobacteria have been used to treat a few medical conditions and the
                therapeutic use has been validated extensively in literature. The mycobacteria
                used for therapeutic purposes are supposed to be either attenuated or non
                pathogenic strains. Growth and dissemination of this mycobacterium is a rare but
                serious possibility. Reactivation of latent mycobacterial infection following
                therapy is also a part of iatrogenic mycobacterial infection. Methods. We report
                a retrospective study investigating adverse events manifesting with development
                of iatrogenic tuberculosis. The data was obtained from a tertiary care centre
                over a period of 2 years. Diagnosis of tuberculosis was established based on
                clinical, radiological(chest X-Ray and High resolution CT scan), sputum smear
                microscopy and skin/tissue biopsy and Xpert MTB/RIF. Tuberculin skin test(TST)
                and Interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) were used as additional diagnostic
                tests. Results. The search yielded 26 cases of iatrogenic tuberculosis, with a
                median age of 56.5 years. Most common cause was reactivation of latent
                tuberculosis due to use of anti-TNF alpha biologic agents(53.8%). Development of
                tuberculosis verrucosa cutis following bcg inoculation for verruca vulgaris was
                noted in about 19.2% of cases and Tubercular abscess due to mycobacterium w or
                bcg inoculation for Covid-19 was noted in 11.5% cases. Bacillus Calmette
                Guérin(bcg) induced balanitis secondary to therapy for Carcinoma urinary bladder
                was noted in 7.69%of cases. Bacillus Calmette-Guerin or bcg induced balanitis
                following use of intravesical immunotherapy for treating early-stage urinary
                bladder cancer and successful clearance of lesions post therapy tuberculosis
                Verrucosa Cutis following Immunotherapy for plantar warts Conclusion. All
                patients were managed successfully with anti tubercular therapy. These
                observations indicate that tuberculosis infection can develop in previously
                healthy individuals in endemic zones following biologic therapy of use of
                mycobacterial agents for other therapeutic indications.

                Background. The prevalence of
                tuberculosis (TB) in Korean children has decreased due to universal bcg
                vaccination and the national TB elimination project. However, exposure to TB in
                children has been consistently reported. There have been few reports of TB
                exposure in the pediatric hematology-oncology ward. Methods. A mother of a
                pediatric cancer patient was diagnosed with active TB with a cavity. Contact
                investigation was performed on patients, their parents, and healthcare workers
                who were exposed to the index case. The criteria for close contact were exposure
                in the same space with the index patient for more than 8 hours continuously or a
                total of 40 hours in case of multiple exposures. The initial assessment was
                performed as soon as the index case was identified. The second evaluation was
                conducted 8-10 weeks after the initial exposure. Both tuberculin skin test
                (TST), TB Specific Interferon-Gamma (T-SPOT) tests, and chest radiography were
                used in immunocompromised pediatric patients. For immunocompetent adults, the
                QuantiFERON-TB Gold (QFT-G) test and chest radiography were performed. Results.
                Total 23 patients and 29 parents were exposed. The median exposure duration of
                patients was 3 days (1-8 days). The initial evaluation did not detect TB
                infection in pediatric patients. However, at the second evaluation, five
                patients (17.4%) were diagnosed with latent TB infection (LTBI, three with
                positive TST and two with positive T-SPOT), and two patients (8.7 %) were
                diagnosed with active TB infection (lymphadenitis and pulmonary TB). Among the
                29 parents, 11 individuals (37.9%) were diagnosed with LTBI at the initial
                evaluation, which was considered as preexisting LTBI before this exposure. No
                additional case of TB infection was identified in the second evaluation. Among
                exposed 24 healthcare workers, two (9.1%) were eventually confirmed as newly
                diagnosed LTBI. Conclusion. TB exposure in pediatric hematology-oncology ward
                and outpatient chemotherapy clinic caused active TB or LTBI cases with an attack
                rate of 26% in children. The high LTBI rate, up to 38% among parents even before
                this exposure, needs further intervention such as routine LTBI evaluation and
                treatment for families of pediatric cancer patients to prevent a similar event.

                Background: The Eastern European
                country of Georgia initiated a nationwide hepatitis C virus (HCV) elimination
                program in 2015 to address a high burden of infection. Screening for HCV
                infection through antibody testing was integrated into multiple existing
                programs, including the National tuberculosis Program (NTP). We sought to
                evaluate loss to follow-up (LTFU) from the hepatitis C care cascade among
                persons diagnosed with active tuberculosis (TB) disease. Methods: Using national
                ID numbers, we merged databases of the HCV elimination program, NTP, and
                national death registry from January 1, 2015, to September 30, 2020. We
                estimated the proportion of patients with and without TB who were LTFU at each
                step of the HCV care cascade and explored temporal changes. Results: Among
                11,985 patients with active TB, 9,065 (76%) were tested for HCV antibodies, and
                1,665 (18%) had a positive result; LTFU from hepatitis C care was common, with
                20% of patients with a positive antibody test not undergoing viremia testing,
                and 43% of patients with viremia not starting treatment for hepatitis C.
                Overall, among persons with confirmed viremic HCV infection, only 28% of
                patients with TB had a documented cure from HCV infection, compared to 55% among
                patients without TB. LTFU after positive antibody testing substantially
                decreased in the last three years, from 32% among patients diagnosed with TB in
                2017 to 12% among those diagnosed in 2019. Conclusions: LTFU from hepatitis C
                care after a positive antibody or viremia test was high and more common among
                patients with TB than in those without TB. Better integration of TB and
                hepatitis C care systems can potentially reduce LTFU and improve patient
                outcomes. Existing large-scale programs for both TB and hepatitis C in Georgia
                create a unique opportunity for such integration to contribute to hepatitis C
                elimination efforts.

                Multidrug resistant tuberculosis
                (MDR-TB) is a primarily pulmonary disease caused by the pathogen mycobacterium
                tuberculosis. Transmission occurs via inhalation of airborne particles called
                droplet nuclei that were previously exhaled by an infected individual. While not
                a very prevalent disease state in the United States, tuberculosis is still the
                ninth leading cause of death worldwide and becomes even more dangerous when it
                develops resistance. There are many drugs available for the treatment of MDR-TB.
                However, several of them have poor safety profiles or lack efficacy leading to
                an increased risk of treatment failure. There is also a concern for developing
                further resistance due to an ineffective regimen or low adherence. For these
                reasons, the American Thoracic Society (ATS), Center for Disease Control and
                Prevention (CDC), European Respiratory Society (ERS), and the Infectious Disease
                Society of America (IDSA) have jointly published recommendations to help manage
                MDR-TB infected patients and prevent the spread of the disease to others. This
                chapter will review the recommended treatment for MDR-TB, as well as strategies
                to prevent transmission and treatment failure. © 2021 by Nova Science

                Among tests presently used in
                clinical medicine, the tuberculin skin test (TST) is one of the few that were
                introduced into clinical use 100 years ago. Given such a long history of use, it
                may seem surprising that the interpretation of the TST remains controversial
                today. However, this reflects the changing epidemiology, clinical features,
                investigation, and management of tuberculosis (TB). In industrialized countries,
                new problems have arisen in the interpretation of the TST in certain high-risk
                populations because of aging, HIV infection, intravenous drug use, and other
                phenomena that may adversely affect immune responsiveness. © 2006 by Taylor and

            <abstract>
                Pulmonary TB disease remains a major
                public health concern despite global efforts deployed by various stake holders.
                A number of strategies have emerged in the effort to control the scourge of TB,
                ranging from bcg vaccination, screening and treatment of active forms and, more
                recently &quot; diagnosing&quot; and treating the latent form of the disease.
                The traditional Tuberculin skin test (TST) has limitations in its use as a
                screening tool for TB (latent and active).The emergence of IGRA (interferon-γ
                release assay) tests as an alternative to the TST opened a new chapter in latent
                TB diagnosis and, by extension, introduced potential strategies for TB control
                in certain population groups. One of such IGRA tests introduced across several
                populations (expatriated and national workforce of an oil service company in
                West Africa) is the Quantiferon TB Gold test. The implementation has rapidly
                raised a number of questions such as the rationale of its use in low versus high
                disease burden populations, but also concerning its benefits in helping to
                identify active TB and trace contacts. This paper intends to provide an overview
                of findings from field utilization in both TB control and screening processes
                and also examines the rationale for treating latent TB, particularly in the
                unique multinational offshore/remote locations which promotes close and often
                prolonged contact and interaction among personnel. While it is not the intent of
                this presentation to provide answers, it will help in formulating the right
                questions, the considerations of which it is hoped will contribute to the
                practical and rational use of these new screening tools in the field. Copyright

            <abstract>
                Approximately 33% of the
                world&apos;s population has latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). For this
                reason, screening for mycobacterium tuberculosis infection is essential for
                public health. People with LBTI are at risk for developing active tuberculosis
                (TB) and becoming infectious. The greatest risk for progression occurs during
                the first two years of infection. The goal of testing for LTBI is to identify
                individuals who are at high risk of developing active TB. The decision to test
                should presuppose a decision to treat if the result is positive. The tuberculin
                skin test (TST) and the interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) are the current
                methods for screening and are based on the measurement of adaptive host immune
                response.

            <abstract>
                Since its discovery in 1882,
                tuberculosis (TB) has long been established as a potentially lethal infectious
                disease with severe complications to its host. While its eradication in
                developed countries proves to be substantial, TB is still a primary concern of
                significant morbidity and mortality in many parts of the world. Caused by
                bacteria known as mycobacterium tuberculosis, this bacterium works by damaging
                the lungs and, hence, affecting the breathing capacities of an individual. Most
                individuals who acquire infection by mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacteria
                species responsible for TB, will eliminate or contain the infection causing it
                to remain latent. Transmission occurs through respiratory droplets of affected
                individuals suffering from active disease.  Issues arise when reactivation of
                the latent disease occurs, causing significant symptoms to the patient and
                allowing the potential to spread. There are two testing methods currently used
                for the identification of latent tuberculosis infection: the tuberculin skin
                test (TST) and interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA). IGRAs diagnose
                tuberculosis infection by either calculating the concentration of interferon-γ
                generated ex vivo by the sufferer&apos;s immune cells or by counting the total
                number of interferon-γ secreting lymphocytes. The tuberculin skin test (TST) is
                performed by injecting a small amount of fluid called tuberculin purified
                protein derivative (PPD) into the forearm. A qualified health care professional
                then measures the induration within 48 to 72 hours of injection and takes into
                account the patient&apos;s background history for indications of a positive or
                negative test result. It should be noted that these testing methods are specific
                for latent tuberculosis infection, as they should not be used for testing active
                disease. The diagnosis of active TB is primarily based on clinical suspicion
                with confirmatory testing through sputum culture analysis.

            <abstract>
                tuberculosis (TB) is a potentially
                fatal bacterial infection caused by the bacterium mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.
                tuberculosis). It is a highly contagious droplet infection that primarily
                affects the lungs. However, it can affect numerous organ systems. Treatment for
                TB is available and effective, yet it remains a significant public health
                concern and a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, especially in
                developing countries. It is estimated that more than 1.7 billion people are
                infected with M. tuberculosis. Although the overall incidence and prevalence of
                tuberculosis have declined, the incidence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis
                remains significant. Active and latent TB Infection (LTBI) A person with an
                active infection usually presents with constitutional symptoms, including
                unexplained weight loss, fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, and night sweats.
                LTBI is asymptomatic and non-infectious. Early diagnosis of active TB is crucial
                to managing and preventing its spread. LTBI has a worldwide prevalence of 33%.
                Those with immunocompromised states are at an increased risk of reactivation and
                progression to active TB disease, which is symptomatic and highly contagious.
                The risk of LTBI progressing to active disease is greatest within the first two
                years of exposure. Therefore, detection and treatment of latent TB are critical
                to controlling the spread of TB and reducing the disease burden. The risk of
                LTBI progression to active disease declines with age, secondary to increased
                immunity. The risk of progression in infants is 50%, and this decreases to 1% to
                2% by age ten. TB Screening Tests Two screening tests are available to detect TB
                infection in the United States: Tuberculin skin (TST) or purified-protein
                derivative (PPD) skin test via the Mantoux technique: Interferon-gamma release
                assay blood test (IGRA). Both tests measure delayed-type hypersensitivity
                reaction or type IV cell-mediated immunity involving T-lymphocytes, which are
                activated after exposure to mycobacteria. Notably, a positive test does not
                distinguish between latent and active TB. Therefore, symptom assessment and
                further testing with chest radiography, sputum test for acid-fast bacilli, or
                chest computed tomography scans are essential to diagnosing active infection.
                There is no definitive test to diagnose LTBI. Instead, it is a clinical
                diagnosis based on a history of prior TB infection and ruling out active
                disease. PPD Skin Test (TST) Robert Koch described the tuberculin reaction in
                1890, and Felix Mandel developed the test in 1908. Charles Mantoux was credited
                with creating the technique of injecting material intradermally on the inner
                surface of the forearm. In 1934, Florence Seibert published her method of
                obtaining the purified-protein derivative, effectively creating the PPD test.
                The tuberculin protein used in the test is extracted from mycobacterium
                tuberculosis cultures and is used as a purified-protein derivative. A
                standardized PPD-S utilizes a tuberculous mycobacterium. Non-tuberculous
                mycobacteria are identified by a letter other than S. The test results are
                interpreted by measuring the delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction. The peak of
                the induration reaction occurs 24 hours after the test and is secondary to cell
                infiltration. It takes approximately six to eight weeks after exposure to
                bacteria for the PPD test to become positive. The PPD test should be read
                between 48 and 72 hours after administration.

                With the overall goal of ending
                tuberculosis (TB), and eventually approaching TB elimination, several
                interventions need to be implemented. They include ‘in primis’ early and rapid
                diagnosis, and effective treatment of people with active disease and with latent
                TB infection. Globally, there are still large gaps in the delivery of TB
                services, and it is crucial to build the capacity of National tuberculosis
                Programmes (NTPs) to deliver coordinated preventive, diagnostic and treatment
                services for all people affected by TB and their families. In their
                organisation, National tuberculosis Programmes need first to ensure the leading
                role and effective functions of the Central Unit in order to implement a
                coordinated set of actions at different levels of the TB programme. These span
                from organising a quality network of laboratories and an efficient drug
                procurement system, to ensuring regular monitoring and surveillance activities
                and quality clinical services. This chapter aims at describing role and
                functions of NTPs at national and subnational levels (general organisation and
                direction) and to review planning activities at different country levels.
                Examples of activities performed by NTPs are also described. Furthermore, the
                chapter proposes an exercise for self-learning. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG

                International migrants make up the
                majority of all tuberculosis (TB) cases in many countries with a low incidence
                of TB. Focusing on TB prevention and treatment among migrants is therefore a
                priority in order to eliminate TB in low-incidence countries. Strategies to
                address TB in migrants include screening for active and latent TB infection
                either pre-migration (pre-entry or at-entry) or post-migration and providing
                free access to culturally appropriate high-quality health services to facilitate
                timely treatment in the destination country. Follow-up programmes for migrants
                deemed to be at high risk of developing TB at the time of initial screening have
                the potential to prevent TB if treatment for latent TB infection is offered, or
                to diagnose TB early if chest radiograph surveillance is implemented. Asylum
                seekers and refugees often have special health needs and adjusted TB screening
                criteria might apply. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

            <abstract>
                tuberculosis (TB) is a disease
                characterized by airborne transmission, slow dynamics, and heterogeneities in
                burden across populations. The spectrum of TB natural history includes latent
                infection (an asymptomatic and non-infectious state), early subclinical disease
                (in which symptoms are not prominent but transmission may presumably occur), and
                “active” disease (which is symptomatic and frequently infectious). Exposure to
                TB is environmentally driven and particularly intense in congregate living
                settings (e.g., prisons and mines), healthcare settings, households of people
                with active TB, and crowded locations often characterized by poverty.
                Progression of TB disease is halted by the host immune system; thus, risk
                factors for developing active TB include immunocompromising conditions such as
                HIV, undernutrition, diabetes, smoking, heavy alcohol use, end-stage renal
                disease, and certain medications. Active TB causes death in approximately 50% of
                untreated individuals, highlighting the importance of early diagnosis and
                initiation of effective treatment, plus prevention in high-risk populations. In
                low-incidence settings, TB is often concentrated among foreign-born individuals
                (particularly recent immigrants), and targets for “pre-elimination” (&lt;10
                incident cases per million population per year) are within sight. In
                high-incidence settings, TB is widespread and strongly associated with poverty
                and other social determinants, thus remaining the leading infectious cause of
                death globally. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

                History of tuberculosis (TB) most
                probably begins around 70,000 years ago when mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)
                and humans co-evolved during their partnership. During the Neolithic Revolution,
                the size of the population and its farming and animal domestication activities
                contributed to the maintenance and transmission of Mtb. TB continued its
                increase beginning around 1750 owing to the deplorable conditions prevailing
                during the Industrial Revolution: overcrowding, malnutrition, absent sanitation.
                Even after Robert Koch’s seminal discovery of Mtb in 1882, methods of diagnosis,
                treatment, and prevention advanced only slowly. After a continuous decline in
                the nineteenth century, TB mortality increased sharply in many countries during
                World Wars I and II. In 1944, first effective anti-TB antibiotics were developed
                and better ones followed in the next years. Major impediments to TB eradication
                or elimination today are drug resistances and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
                infection. The World Health Organization (WHO) created the End TB Strategy in
                2014, but achieving its goals appears unlikely by 2030. Possible solutions
                include widespread treatment for latent TB infection and an effective vaccine. ©

                There is an increased awareness of
                the long-term physical, psychological and socioeconomic consequences that can
                follow apparently successful treatment for tuberculosis (TB). In this chapter,
                we describe the high burden of residual lung damage post-treatment for pulmonary
                tuberculosis, as well as the common associated respiratory infections. Patterns
                of post-TB lung disease (PTLD) are heterogenous, with no standardised tools for
                diagnosis or measurement. However, it is clear that the condition includes
                pleural, parenchymal and airway pathology, which may be particularly severe
                after multidrug resistant disease. Prospective data describing the long-term
                sequelae of PTLD are limited, but given the high burden of bronchiectasis,
                residual cavities and parenchymal destruction, these likely include infective
                exacerbations with bacterial or viral pathogens, and superimposed infection with
                aspergillus and non-tuberculous mycobacteria. There are few data reporting the
                incidence of post-TB infections amongst (an increasing number of) TB survivors
                in high-or low-income settings, but basic approaches to their diagnosis and
                management are described here. The importance of broad respiratory care,
                including tobacco cessation, and the need for further evidence for interventions
                to improve long-term respiratory outcomes after completing treatment for TB are
                highlighted. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

                Diagnosis and treatment of latent
                tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is one of the interventions recommended by the
                World Health Organization (WHO) to end the TB epidemic worldwide and is one of
                the elements of the post-2015 End TB Strategy (1). While several high-income
                countries, notably the United States and Canada, have implemented and scaled up
                programs to detect and treat LTBI, developing countries have mostly focused on
                active TB disease control, a much bigger priority in these settings. © 2018 by

                Objectives Metaanalysis of
                randomised controlled trials has shown that TNF-inhibitors are effective in RA.
                These trials however are undertaken in highly selective populations; under an
                experimental setting that may differ from that of clinical practice, and follow
                up rarely extend beyond 1 year. In addition all trials were sponsored by the
                manufacturer. We were asked to extend the review and meta-analysis of RCTs with
                a review of data from registries to evaluate efficacy and safety of
                TNF-inhibitors when used in clinical practice (real world). We focused
                particularly on the following questions: What is the efficacy of TNF-inhibitors
                when used outside clinical trials? What is the efficacy of TNF-inhibitors after
                long term use? What adverse events are reported in these studies? What is the
                risk of malignancies following long term use? What are the experiences
                concerning use of medication, treatment compliance and change of medication?
                Methods We searched Medline and Embase June 2006 by combining search terms for
                registries, cohort studies and databases with terms for TNF-inhibitors and
                rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We included publications from registries or databases
                on adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis
                (RA), ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis or juvenile idiopathic
                arthritis. Manufacturers were also invited to submit data. Outcomes considered
                were efficacy, safety and medication use. Results The search gave 290 hits, 64
                references were retrieved and assessed in full text, and 23 publications finally
                included. These studies covered patients with RA, in addition we found one study
                on juvenile idiopathic arthritis. We did not identify relevant studies on
                ankylosing spondylitis or psoriatic arthritis. The summary of the results from
                the studies are as follows: Effectiveness: We included seven studies from
                registries and databases reporting clinical effects of TNF-inhibitors. In
                summary these studies showed that TNFinhibitors were effective also when used in
                clinical practice. The effect however appeared to be lower compared with RCTs.
                This could be explained by a more heterogeneous patient population. In addition
                patients in clinical practice often continued with existing medication, opposed
                to most clinical trials where patients often discontinued existing medications
                before enrolling. Although we aimed to 9 assess long-term effectiveness, few
                patients have been followed beyond 2-3 years of treatment. One study assessed
                patients with JIA, in this study treatment with TNF-inhibitor (etanercept) led
                to a significant reduction of the disease activity in most of the patients.
                Combination therapy: Two randomised controlled trials and data from registries
                evaluated the combination of TNF and MTX treatment. Treatment with TNFinhibitors
                and methotrexate (MTX) appeared more effective than treatment with TNFinhibitor
                alone in reducing the disease activity in patients with RA. . Cancer: We
                included six publications that assessed cancer risk following TNFtreatment. A
                general comments to these studies is that patients have not been followed
                sufficiently long to allow for conclusions regarding cancer risk. Four studies
                analysed risk of lymphoma or leukaemia, with inconsistent results. Two studies
                analysed risk of solid cancer, with inconcistent results. Experiences from
                transplantation patients shows that cancer usually develops 10-15 years after
                immunosuppressive medication. Hence, these studies does not give any further
                information about the risk of developing cancer following treatment with
                TNF-inhibitors than reported in the randomized controlled trials. Infections:
                Treatment with TNF-inhibitors were associated with increase the risk of
                infections. In particular, the risk of reactivation of latent tuberculosis.
                However, routine screening and treatment of tuberculosis prior to TNF-treatment
                have reduced this risk considerably. Compliance: Continuation of treatment with
                TNF-inhibitors (etanercept og infliximab) after one year was between 62-73 %.
                This number is lower than compared with RCTs . The reasons for ceasing
                TNF-treatment were in most cases adverse events or lack of effect. However, it
                was found that the compliance to TNF-inhibitors was higher then for traditional
                DMARDs. Conclusion: In conclusion, results from clinical trials and registries
                show that TNF-inhibitors are effective, also when used on a broader patient
                population outside the setting of clinical trials. Treatment with TNF-inhibitors
                is associated with increased risk of infections, in particular tuberculosis.
                Included studies does not allow for conclusion regarding risk of cancer. Thus,
                the issue of long term safety is at time being incomplete, with a follow up of
                2-3 years in most studies. A national registry for treatment with TNF-inhibitors
                (and other biologics) in Norway would be a very helpful tool to identify the
                effect and adverse events after longtreatment with TNF-inhibitors.

                tuberculosis (TB) is the major cause
                of death from infectious diseases around the world, particularly in HIV infected
                individuals. TB vaccine design and development have been focused on improving
                Bacille Calmette-Guérin (bcg) and evaluating recombinant and viral vector
                expressed mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) proteins, for boosting bcg-primed
                immunity, but these approaches have not yet yielded significant improvements
                over the modest effects of bcg in protecting against infection or disease. On
                March 7–8, 2016, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
                (NIAID) convened a workshop on “The Impact of Mtb Immune Evasion on Protective
                Immunity: Implications for TB Vaccine Design” with the goal of defining immune
                mechanisms that could be targeted through novel research approaches, to inform
                vaccine design and immune therapeutic interventions for prevention of TB. The
                workshop addressed early infection events, the impact of Mtb evolution on the
                development and maintenance of an adaptive immune response, and the factors that
                influence protection against and progression to active disease. Scientific gaps
                and areas of study to revitalize and accelerate TB vaccine design were discussed
                and prioritized. These included a comprehensive evaluation of innate and
                Mtb–specific adaptive immune responses in the lung at different stages of
                disease; determining the role of B cells and antibodies (Abs) during Mtb

            <abstract>
                tuberculosis (TB) is one of the most
                prevalent infectious diseases worldwide and accounts for a large portion of all
                preventable deaths. latent TB infection is also extremely common, affecting as
                many as one-third of humans alive today. Fortunately, only about 10% of TB
                infection leads to active TB disease. TB is curable with proper treatment, but
                treatment programs are labor intensive and increasingly threatened by drug
                resistance. Furthermore, the long treatment regimen poses compliance problems,
                and lack of access to TB care is common. As a consequence of these combined
                factors, TB continues to claim 2 million lives per year. An effective vaccine
                reliably preventing TB disease in adults would significantly reduce the number
                of deaths due to TB; however, no such vaccine is available. A live attenuated
                strain of mycobacterium bovis, bacille Calmette–Guérin (bcg), is used with
                variable efficacy to vaccinate children against TB in many countries throughout
                the world. Because bcg protects against meningeal TB in children and against
                leprosy in adults, it will be difficult to justify replacing bcg with a new TB
                vaccine unless that vaccine is an improved version of bcg, which may take
                decades to develop and test. Effective vaccines that could be administered
                against a background of bcg immunization and/or preexisting mycobacterium
                tuberculosis (Mtb) infection (“postinfection” vaccines) stand to make the
                greatest and most immediate impact on TB control. This chapter highlights the
                most recent history of TB vaccine development and describes TB vaccines that are
                in the research and clinical pipelines. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved

                In Africa, TB-HIV co-infection rates
                are estimated to be 72%. Within sub-Saharan Africa, 34 countries recently
                reported patients with newly diagnosed MDR-TB, representing 14% of all emerging
                multi-drug resistant reports worldwide. In addition, eight African countries
                reported patients harboring extensively drug-resistant TB. More importantly,
                sub-Saharan Africa bears unacceptably high TB incidence rates coupled with the
                highest HIV prevalence rates globally. Occurrence of TB related death and new TB
                infections persist, with men disproportionately affected. A gradual reduction in
                TB incidence rates from 1.4% per annum between 2000 to 2017 to 1.9% per annum
                between 2015 and 2016 has been observed. Of note, eight out of the sixteen high
                burden African countries showed a sharp decline in TB incidence rates,
                surpassing the “End TB Strategy” goal of a 4% per annum decline. Additionally,
                substantial decreases in TB mortality in HIV infected patients in nine of
                sixteen high TB burden African countries were also observed. Programmatic uptake
                and scale up of TB screening, introduction of new TB diagnostic tests, TB
                preventive therapy and ART have collectively contributed to this success.
                Regardless of these improvements, TB remains Africa’s foremost cause of
                ill-health and death, with greater efforts required in curbing drug resistant TB
                incidence, poor drug resistant TB treatment outcomes, and in finding and
                treating missing TB patients. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019. All rights
