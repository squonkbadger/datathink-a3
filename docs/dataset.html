<h1>Information about the dataset</h1>
<p>The dataset is a sample of references stored in an EndNote library, resulted from a scoping review project on latent tuberculosis and cascade of care. In this particular project, the searches were run in <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">PubMed</a>, <a href="https://embase.com">Embase.com</a>, and <a href="https://www.scopus.com">Scopus</a>. 
The metadata included in the EndNote library serves to build references following the <a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/72642.html"><i>ISO 690:2021</i></a>.</p>
<h2>The curation of the dataset</h2>
<p>The data included in the dataset needs to varied so that the algorithm can perform a diversity of tasks. Thus, we generated a new EndNote library with randomly 500 references selected from the original EndNote library in the scoping review.</p>
<p>It was advantageous to start with such large dataset so that we could make a final choice of 59 records with different reference types:</p>	
<ul>
	<li>Book</li>
	<li>Book section</li>
	<li>Conference proceedings</li>
	<li>Electronic article</li>
	<li>Journal article</li>
</ul>
