<p>This website is created for the course Datalogical Thinking, held at the University of Bor√•s in the fall semester of 2023/2024.</p>
<p>The website displays information about the A3: Project: Algorithm Design.</p>
<p>The project consists of five parts:
<ol>
  <li>Conceptualisation</li>
  <li>Dataset curation</li>
  <li>Algorithm design</li>
  <li>Website curation</li>
  <li>Publishing the work on GitHub</li>
</ol>
<p>The website consists of three sections:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="dataset.html">Dataset</a>: description of the dataset and of the dataset curation process</li>
  <li><a href="algorithm.html">Algorithm</a>: informations about the algorithm, its design process, and usage example</li>
  <li><a href="people.html">People</a>: information about the group members</li>
</ul>
<p><b></b>The A3 Project complies with the minimal requirements:</b></p>
<ul>
  <li>The dataset has been curated for the algorithm to perform properly, contains 59 items, and has a .xml file</li>
  <li>The algorithm is written in markdown, has 36 lines of code, and includes a path, a variable, and several selections</li>
  <li>The website contains the files index.html, dataset.html, algorithm.html, and people.html</li>
  <li>The assignment is submitted as a GitHub repository</li>
  <li>The website uses the GitHub pages</li>
</ul>
